<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>
","<p>There are several ways to store tree-structured data in a relational database.  What you show in your example uses two methods:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Adjacency List</strong> (the ""parent"" column) and </li>
<li><strong>Path Enumeration</strong> (the dotted-numbers in your name column).  </li>
</ul>

<p>Another solution is called <strong>Nested Sets</strong>, and it can be stored in the same table too.  Read ""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1558609202"">Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties</a>"" by Joe Celko for a lot more information on these designs.</p>

<p>I usually prefer a design called <strong>Closure Table</strong> (aka ""Adjacency Relation"") for storing tree-structured data.  It requires another table, but then querying trees is pretty easy.</p>

<p>I cover Closure Table in my presentation <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data"">Models for Hierarchical Data with SQL and PHP</a> and in my book <a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/bksqla/sql-antipatterns"">SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming</a>.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ClosureTable (
  ancestor_id   INT NOT NULL REFERENCES FlatTable(id),
  descendant_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES FlatTable(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (ancestor_id, descendant_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>Store all paths in the Closure Table, where there is a direct ancestry from one node to another.  Include a row for each node to reference itself.  For example, using the data set you showed in your question:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO ClosureTable (ancestor_id, descendant_id) VALUES
  (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6),
  (2,2), (2,4),
  (3,3), (3,5),
  (4,4),
  (5,5),
  (6,6);
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can get a tree starting at node 1 like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT f.* 
FROM FlatTable f 
  JOIN ClosureTable a ON (f.id = a.descendant_id)
WHERE a.ancestor_id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>The output (in MySQL client) looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>+----+
| id |
+----+
|  1 | 
|  2 | 
|  4 | 
|  6 | 
+----+
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, nodes 3 and 5 are excluded, because they're part of a separate hierarchy, not descending from node 1.</p>

<hr>

<p>Re: comment from e-satis about immediate children (or immediate parent).  You can add a ""<code>path_length</code>"" column to the <code>ClosureTable</code> to make it easier to query specifically for an immediate child or parent (or any other distance).</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO ClosureTable (ancestor_id, descendant_id, path_length) VALUES
  (1,1,0), (1,2,1), (1,4,2), (1,6,1),
  (2,2,0), (2,4,1),
  (3,3,0), (3,5,1),
  (4,4,0),
  (5,5,0),
  (6,6,0);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can add a term in your search for querying the immediate children of a given node.  These are descendants whose <code>path_length</code> is 1.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT f.* 
FROM FlatTable f 
  JOIN ClosureTable a ON (f.id = a.descendant_id)
WHERE a.ancestor_id = 1
  AND path_length = 1;

+----+
| id |
+----+
|  2 | 
|  6 | 
+----+
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Re comment from @ashraf: ""How about sorting the whole tree [by name]?""</p>

<p>Here's an example query to return all nodes that are descendants of node 1, join them to the FlatTable that contains other node attributes such as <code>name</code>, and sort by the name.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT f.name
FROM FlatTable f 
JOIN ClosureTable a ON (f.id = a.descendant_id)
WHERE a.ancestor_id = 1
ORDER BY f.name;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Re comment from @Nate:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT f.name, GROUP_CONCAT(b.ancestor_id order by b.path_length desc) AS breadcrumbs
FROM FlatTable f 
JOIN ClosureTable a ON (f.id = a.descendant_id) 
JOIN ClosureTable b ON (b.descendant_id = a.descendant_id) 
WHERE a.ancestor_id = 1 
GROUP BY a.descendant_id 
ORDER BY f.name

+------------+-------------+
| name       | breadcrumbs |
+------------+-------------+
| Node 1     | 1           |
| Node 1.1   | 1,2         |
| Node 1.1.1 | 1,2,4       |
| Node 1.2   | 1,6         |
+------------+-------------+
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>A user suggested an edit today. SO moderators approved the edit, but I am reversing it.</p>

<p>The edit suggested that the ORDER BY in the last query above should be <code>ORDER BY b.path_length, f.name</code>, presumably to make sure the ordering matches the hierarchy. But this doesn't work, because it would order ""Node 1.1.1"" after ""Node 1.2"".</p>

<p>If you want the ordering to match the hierarchy in a sensible way, that is possible, but not simply by ordering by the path length. For example, see my answer to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8252323/mysql-closure-table-hierarchical-database-how-to-pull-information-out-in-the-c"">MySQL Closure Table hierarchical database - How to pull information out in the correct order</a>.</p>

<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>
","<p>If nested hash maps or arrays can be created, then I can simply go down the table from the beginning and add each item to the nested array. I must trace each line to the root node in order to know which level in the nested array to insert into. I can employ memoization so that I do not need to look up the same parent over and over again.</p>

<p>Edit: I would read the entire table into an array first, so it will not query the DB repeatedly. Of course this won't be practical if your table is very large.</p>

<p>After the structure is built, I must do a depth first traverse through it and print out the HTML.</p>

<p>There's no better fundamental way to store this information using one table (I could be wrong though ;), and would love to see a better solution ). However, if you create a scheme to employ dynamically created db tables, then you opened up a whole new world at the sacrifice of simplicity, and the risk of SQL hell ;).</p>

","<p>You can emulate any other data structure with a hashmap, so that's not a terrible limitation.  Scanning from the top to the bottom, you create a hashmap for each row of the database, with an entry for each column. Add each of these hashmaps to a ""master"" hashmap, keyed on the id. If any node has a ""parent"" that you haven't seen yet, create an placeholder entry for it in the master hashmap, and fill it in when you see the actual node.</p>

<p>To print it out, do a simple depth-first pass through the data, keeping track of indent level along the way. You can make this easier by keeping a ""children"" entry for each row, and populating it as you scan the data.</p>

<p>As for whether there's a ""better"" way to store a tree in a database, that depends on how you're going to use the data. I've seen systems that had a known maximum depth that used a different table for each level in the hierarchy. That makes a lot of sense if the levels in the tree aren't quite equivalent after all (top level categories being different than the leaves).</p>

","<p>Well given the choice, I'd be using objects. I'd create an object for each record where each object has a <code>children</code> collection and store them all in an assoc array (/hashtable) where the Id is the key. And blitz through the collection once, adding the children to the relevant children fields. <strong>Simple.</strong></p>

<p>But because you're being no fun by restricting use of some good OOP, I'd probably iterate based on:</p>

<pre><code>function PrintLine(int pID, int level)
    foreach record where ParentID == pID
        print level*tabs + record-data
        PrintLine(record.ID, level + 1)

PrintLine(0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: this is similar to a couple of other entries, but I think it's slightly cleaner. One thing I'll add: this is extremely SQL-intensive. It's <em>nasty</em>. <strong>If you have the choice, go the OOP route.</strong></p>

<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>
","<p>If elements are in tree order, as shown in your example, you can use something like the following Python example:</p>

<pre><code>delimiter = '.'
stack = []
for item in items:
  while stack and not item.startswith(stack[-1]+delimiter):
    print ""&lt;/div&gt;""
    stack.pop()
  print ""&lt;div&gt;""
  print item
  stack.append(item)
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is maintain a stack representing the current position in the tree. For each element in the table, it pops stack elements (closing the matching divs) until it finds the parent of the current item. Then it outputs the start of that node and pushes it to the stack.</p>

<p>If you want to output the tree using indenting rather than nested elements, you can simply skip the print statements to print the divs, and print a number of spaces equal to some multiple of the size of the stack before each item. For example, in Python:</p>

<pre><code>print ""  "" * len(stack)
</code></pre>

<p>You could also easily use this method to construct a set of nested lists or dictionaries.</p>

<p>Edit: I see from your clarification that the names were not intended to be node paths. That suggests an alternate approach:</p>

<pre><code>idx = {}
idx[0] = []
for node in results:
  child_list = []
  idx[node.Id] = child_list
  idx[node.ParentId].append((node, child_list))
</code></pre>

<p>This constructs a tree of arrays of tuples(!). idx[0] represents the root(s) of the tree. Each element in an array is a 2-tuple consisting of the node itself and a list of all its children. Once constructed, you can hold on to idx[0] and discard idx, unless you want to access nodes by their ID.</p>

<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>
","<p>If you use nested sets (sometimes referred to as Modified Pre-order Tree Traversal) you can extract the entire tree structure or any subtree within it in tree order with a single query, at the cost of inserts being more expensive, as you need to manage columns which describe an in-order path through thee tree structure.</p>

<p>For <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/"">django-mptt</a>, I used a structure like this:</p>

<pre>
id  parent_id  tree_id  level  lft  rght
--  ---------  -------  -----  ---  ----
 1       null        1      0    1    14
 2          1        1      1    2     7
 3          2        1      2    3     4
 4          2        1      2    5     6
 5          1        1      1    8    13
 6          5        1      2    9    10
 7          5        1      2    11   12
</pre>

<p>Which describes a tree which looks like this (with <code>id</code> representing each item):</p>

<pre>
 1
 +-- 2
 |   +-- 3
 |   +-- 4
 |
 +-- 5
     +-- 6
     +-- 7
</pre>

<p>Or, as a nested set diagram which makes it more obvious how the <code>lft</code> and <code>rght</code> values work:</p>

<pre>
 __________________________________________________________________________
|  Root 1                                                                  |
|   ________________________________    ________________________________   |
|  |  Child 1.1                     |  |  Child 1.2                     |  |
|  |   ___________    ___________   |  |   ___________    ___________   |  |
|  |  |  C 1.1.1  |  |  C 1.1.2  |  |  |  |  C 1.2.1  |  |  C 1.2.2  |  |  |
1  2  3___________4  5___________6  7  8  9___________10 11__________12 13 14
|  |________________________________|  |________________________________|  |
|__________________________________________________________________________|
</pre>

<p>As you can see, to get the entire subtree for a given node, in tree order, you simply have to select all rows which have <code>lft</code> and <code>rght</code> values between its <code>lft</code> and <code>rght</code> values. It's also simple to retrieve the tree of ancestors for a given node.</p>

<p>The <code>level</code> column is a bit of denormalisation for convenience more than anything and the <code>tree_id</code> column allows you to restart the <code>lft</code> and <code>rght</code> numbering for each top-level node, which reduces the number of columns affected by inserts, moves and deletions, as the <code>lft</code> and <code>rght</code> columns have to be adjusted accordingly when these operations take place in order to create or close gaps. I made some <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/source/browse/trunk/NOTES"">development notes</a> at the time when I was trying to wrap my head around the queries required for each operation.</p>

<p>In terms of actually working with this data to display a tree, I created a <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/source/browse/trunk/mptt/utils.py#29""><code>tree_item_iterator</code></a> utility function which, for each node, should give you sufficient information to generate whatever kind of display you want.</p>

443,192220,1,370,sql,What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree?,"<p>Assume you have a flat table that stores an ordered tree hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>Id   Name         ParentId   Order

 2   'Node 1.1'          1      10

 4   'Node 1.1.1'        2      10
 5   'Node 2.1'          3      10
 6   'Node 1.2'          1      20
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a diagram, where we have <code>[id] Name</code>.  Root node 0 is fictional.</p>

<pre>
                       [0] ROOT
                          /    \

</pre>

<p>What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree? </p>

<p>Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly. </p>

<p>Pseudo code or plain English is okay, this is purely a conceptional question.</p>

<p>Bonus question: Is there a fundamentally better way to store a tree structure like this in a RDBMS?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDITS AND ADDITIONS</strong></p>

<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>
","<p>To Extend Bill's SQL solution you can basically do the same using a flat array.  Further more if your strings all have the same lenght and your maximum number of children are known (say in a binary tree) you can do it using a single string (character array).  If you have arbitrary number of children this complicates things a bit...  I would have to check my old notes to see what can be done.</p>

<p>Then, sacrificing a bit of memory, especially if your tree is sparse and/or unballanced, you can, with a bit of index math, access all the strings randomly by storing your tree, width first in the array like so (for a binary tree):</p>

<pre><code>String[] nodeArray = [L0root, L1child1, L1child2, L2Child1, L2Child2, L2Child3, L2Child4] ...
</code></pre>

<p>yo know your string length, you know it

<p>I'm at work now so cannot spend much time on it but with interest I can fetch a bit of code to do this.  </p>

<p>We use to do it to search in binary trees made of DNA codons, a process built the tree, then we flattened it to search text patterns and when found, though index math (revers from above) we get the node back...  very fast and efficient, tough our tree rarely had empty nodes, but we could searh gigabytes of data in a jiffy.</p>

If you are doing an inner join, so not add any where conditions to the on clause, put them in the where clause </p>

<p>If you are doing a left join, add any where conditions to the on clause for the table in the right side of the join. This is a must because adding a where clause that references the right side of the join will convert the join to an inner join (With one exception described below). </p>

<p>The exception is that when you are looking for the records that are not in a particular table, you would add the refernce to a unique identifier(that is not ever null) in the right join table to the where clause this way ""Where t2.idfield is null"". So the only time you should reference a table on the right side of the join is to find those records which are not in the table.</p>

","<p>On an inner join, they mean the same thing. However you will get different results in an outer join depending on if you put the join condition in the WHERE vs the ON clause. Take a look at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/219046/help-with-a-where-on-a-left-join-sql-query"">this related question</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/219046/help-with-a-where-on-a-left-join-sql-query#219053"">this answer</a> (by me).</p>

<p>I think it makes the most sense to be in the habit of always putting the join condition in the ON clause (unless it is an outer join and you actually do want it in the where clause) as it makes it clearer to anyone reading your query what conditions the tables are being joined on, and also it helps prevent the WHERE clause from being dozens of lines long.</p>

","<h3>Update as of PostgreSQL 9.0:</h3>

<p>Recent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-TABLE""><code>string_agg(expression, delimiter)</code></a> function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT company_id, string_agg(employee, ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;
</code></pre>

<h3>Update as of PostgreSQL 8.4:</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/functions-aggregate.html"">the aggregate function <code>array_agg(expression)</code></a> which concatenates the values into an array. Then <code>array_to_string()</code> can be used to give the desired result:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT company_id, array_to_string(array_agg(employee), ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):</h3>

<p>There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations <a href=""http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-novice/2003-09/msg00177.php"">the same example</a>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,
  sfunc       = textcat,
  stype       = text,
  initcond    = ''
);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-createaggregate.html"">Here is the <code>CREATE AGGREGATE</code> documentation.</a></p>

<p>In order to get the "", "" inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the ""textcat"" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (<strong><em>update:</strong> tested on 8.3.12 and working fine</em>):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:</em></p>

<pre><code>a, b, c, , e, , g
</code></pre>

<p><em>If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:</em></p>

<pre><code>a, b, c, e, g
</code></pre>

<p><em>just add an <code>ELSIF</code> check to the function:</em></p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION commacat_ignore_nulls(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSIF instr IS NULL OR instr = '' THEN
      RETURN acc;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

<p>Some database systems, however, may treat collation settings differently with the different operators.</p>

<p>Without any special operators, <code>LIKE</code> and <code>=</code> are the same, right?</p>
","<p>The equals (=) operator is a ""comparison operator compares two values for equality.""  In other words, in an SQL statement, it won't return true unless both sides of the equation are equal.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Store WHERE Quantity = 200;
</code></pre>

<p>The LIKE operator ""implements a pattern match comparison"" that attempts to match ""a string value against a pattern string containing wild-card characters.""  For example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE 'Chris%';
</code></pre>

<p>LIKE is generally used only with strings and equals (I believe) is faster.  The equals operator treats wild-card characters as literal characters.  The difference in results returned are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'Chris';
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE 'Chris';
</code></pre>

<p>Would return the same result, though using LIKE would generally take longer as its a pattern match.  However,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'Chris%';
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE 'Chris%';
</code></pre>

<p>Would return different results, where using ""="" results in only results with ""Chris%"" being returned and the LIKE operator will return anything starting with ""Chris"".</p>

<p>Without any special operators, <code>LIKE</code> and <code>=</code> are the same, right?</p>
","<p>If you search for an exact match, you can use both,  = and LIKE.</p>

<p>Using ""="" is a tiny bit faster in this case (searching for an exact match) - you can check this yourself by having the same query twice in SQL Server Management Studio, once using ""="", once using ""LIKE"", and then using the ""Query"" / ""Include actual execution plan"".</p>

<p>Execute the two queries and you should see your results twice, plus the two actual execution plans. In my case, they were split 50% vs. 50%, but the ""="" execution plan has a smaller ""estimated subtree cost"" (displayed when you hover over the left-most ""SELECT"" box) - but again, it's really not a huge difference.</p>

<p>But when you start searching with wildcards in your LIKE expression, search performance will dimish. Search ""LIKE Mill%"" can still be quite fast - SQL Server can use an index on that column, if there is one. Searching ""LIKE %expression%"" is horribly slow, since the only way SQL Server can satisfy this search is by doing a full table scan. So be careful with your LIKE's ! </p>

","<p>Here's a list of differences. I've highlighted Oracle-specific features, and hopefully the community can add in other vendors' specific difference also. Differences that are common to most vendors can go directly below the headings, with differences highlighted below.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>General Overview</h1>

<p>If you want to quickly delete all of the rows from a table, and you're really sure that you want to do it, and you do not have foreign keys against the tables, then a TRUNCATE is probably going to be faster than a DELETE.</p>

<p>Various system-specific issues have to be considered, as detailed below.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Statement type</h1>

<p>Delete is DML, Truncate is DDL</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Commit and Rollback</h1>

<p>Variable by vendor</p>

<p><strong>SQL*Server</strong></p>

<p>Truncate can be rolled back.</p>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>

<p>Truncate can be rolled back.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>Because a TRUNCATE is DDL it involves two commits, one before and one after the statement execution. Truncate can therefore not be rolled back, and a failure in the truncate process will have issued a commit anyway.</p>

<p>However, see Flashback below.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Space reclamation</h1>

<p>Delete does not recover space, Truncate recovers space</p>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>If you use the REUSE STORAGE clause then the data segments are not de-allocated, which can be marginally more efficient if the table is to be reloaded with data. The high water mark is reset.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Row scope</h1>

<p>Delete can remove only some rows. Truncate removes all rows.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>When a table is partitioned, the individual partitions can be truncated in isolation, thus a partial removal of all the table's data is possible.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Object types</h1>

<p>Delete can be applied to tables and tables inside a cluster. Truncate applies only to tables or the entire cluster. (May be Oracle specific)</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Data Object Identity</h1>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>Delete does not affect the data object id, but truncate assigns a new data object id <em>unless</em> there has never been an insert against the table since its creation Even a single insert that is rolled back will cause a new data object id to be assigned upon truncation.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Flashback (Oracle)</h1>

<p>Flashback works across deletes, but a truncate prevents flashback to states prior to the operation.</p>

<p>However, from 11gR2 the FLASHBACK ARCHIVE feature allows this, except in Express Edition</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25950145/use-of-flashback-in-oracle"">Use of FLASHBACK in Oracle</a>
<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_flashback.htm#ADFNS638"">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_flashback.htm#ADFNS638</a></p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Privileges</h1>

<p>Variable</p>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>Delete can be granted on a table to another user or role, but truncate cannot be without using a DROP ANY TABLE grant.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Redo/Undo</h1>

<p>Delete generates a small amount of redo and a large amount of undo. Truncate generates a negligible amount of each.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Indexes</h1>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>A truncate operation renders unusable indexes usable again. Delete does not.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Foreign Keys</h1>

<p>A truncate cannot be applied when an enabled foreign key references the table. Treatment with delete depends on the configuration of the foreign keys.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Table Locking</h1>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>Truncate requires an exclusive table lock, delete requires a shared table lock. Hence disabling table locks is a way of preventing truncate operations on a table.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Triggers</h1>

<p>DML triggers do not fire on a truncate.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>DDL triggers are available.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Remote Execution</h1>

<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>

<p>Truncate cannot be issued over a database link.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Identity Columns</h1>

<p><strong>SQL*Server</strong></p>

<p>Truncate resets the sequence for IDENTITY column types, delete does not.</p>

332,149380,4,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]

    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2

            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>There's a couple of different ways you can hack this in. </p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ol>
<li>Only one SELECT statement in the
sp </li>
<li>Leave out any sorting (or have
a default)</li>
</ol>

<p>Then insert into a temp table:</p>

<pre><code>create table #temp ( your columns )

insert #temp
exec foobar

select * from #temp order by whatever
</code></pre>

<p>Method #2: set up a linked server back to itself, then select from this using openquery:

330,149380,2,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>How about handling sorting on the stuff displaying the results -- grids, reports, etc. rather than on SQL?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>To clarify things since this answer got down-voted earlier, I'll elaborate a bit...</p>

<p>You stated you knew about client-side sorting but wanted to steer clear of it.  That's your call, of course.</p>

<p>What I want to point out, though, is that by doing it on the client-side, you're able to pull data ONCE and then work with it however you want -- versus doing multiple trips back and forth to the server each time the sort gets changed.</p>

<p>Your SQL Server isn't getting taxed right now and that's awesome. It shouldn't be. But just because it isn't overloaded yet doesn't mean that it'll stay like that forever.</p>

<p>If you're using any of the newer ASP.NET stuff for displaying on the web, a lot of that stuff is already baked right in.</p>

<p>Is it worth adding so much code to each stored procedure just to handle sorting? Again, your call. </p>

<p>I'm not the one who will ultimately be in charge of supporting it.  But give some thought to what will be involved as columns are added/removed within the various datasets used by the stored procedures (requiring modifications to the CASE statements) or when suddenly instead of sorting by two columns, the user decides they need three -- requiring you to now update every one of your stored procedures that uses this method.</p>

<p>For me, it's worth it to get a working client-side solution and apply it to the handful of user-facing displays of data and be done with it.  If a new column is added, it's already handled. If the user wants to sort by multiple columns, they can sort by two or twenty of them.</p>

326,149380,3,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.

327,149380,6,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>Dynamic SQL is still an option. You just have to decide whether that option is more palatable than what you currently have.</p>

334,149380,-6,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>You should avoid the SQL Server sorting, unless if necessary. Why not sort on app server or client side? Also .NET Generics does exceptional sortin</p>

<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>This solution might only work in .NET, I don't know.   </p>

<p>I fetch the data into the C# with the initial sort order in the SQL order by clause, put that data in a DataView, cache it in a Session variable, and use it to build a page.</p>

<p>When the user clicks on a column heading to sort (or page, or filter), I don't go back to the database.  Instead, I go back to my cached DataView and set its ""Sort"" property to an expression I build dynamically, just like I would dynamic SQL.    ( I do the filtering the same way, using the ""RowFilter"" property).</p>

<p>You can see/feel it working in a demo of my app, BugTracker.NET, at <a href=""http://ifdefined.com/btnet/bugs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifdefined.com/btnet/bugs.aspx</a></p>

328,149380,69,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

</ul>
","<p>Yeah, it's a pain, and the way you're doing it looks similar to what I do:</p>

<pre><code>order by
case when @SortExpr = 'CustomerName' and @SortDir = 'ASC' 
    then CustomerName end asc, 
case when @SortExpr = 'CustomerName' and @SortDir = 'DESC' 
    then CustomerName end desc,
...
</code></pre>

<p>This, to me, is still much better than building dynamic SQL from code, which turns into a scalability and maintenance nightmare for DBAs.</p>

<p>What I do from code is refactor the paging and sorting so I at least don't have a lot of repetition there with populating values for @SortExpr and @SortDir.</p>

<p>As far as the SQL is concerned, keep the design and formatting the same between different stored procedures, so it's at least neat and recognizable when you go in to make changes.</p>

            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>
</ul>
","<p>There may be a third option, since your server has lots of spare cycles - use a helper procedure to do the sorting via a temporary table. Something like</p>

<pre><code>create procedure uspCallAndSort
(
    @sql varchar(2048),        --exec dbo.uspSomeProcedure arg1,'arg2',etc.
    @sortClause varchar(512)    --comma-delimited field list
)
AS
insert into #tmp EXEC(@sql)
declare @msql varchar(3000)
set @msql = 'select * from #tmp order by ' + @sortClause
EXEC(@msql)
drop table #tmp
GO
</code></pre>

<p>Caveat: I haven't tested this, but it ""should"" work in SQL Server 2005 (which will create a temporary table from a result set without specifying the columns in advance.)</p>

331,149380,5,104,sql,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/T-SQL/61773/"">Importance of UPSERT - from sqlservercentral.com</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.</p>
  
  <p>The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.</p>

","<p>In many cases, stored procedures are actually slower because they're more genaralized. While stored procedures can be highly tuned, in my experience there's enough development and institutional friction that they're left in place once they work, so stored procedures often tend to return a lot of columns ""just in case"" - because you don't want to deploy a new stored procedure every time you change your application. An OR/M, on the other hand, only requests the columns the application is using, which cuts down on network traffic, unnecessary joins, etc.</p>

","<p>Reduced network traffic -- SP are generally worse then Dynamic SQL.  Because people don't create a new SP for every select, if you need just one column you are told use the SP that has the columns they need and ignore the rest.  Get an extra column and any less network usage you had just went away.  Also you tend to have a lot of client filtering when SP are used.</p>

<p>permissions -- Not a problem since almost everything I do is web or have some middle application tier that does all the database access.  The only software I work with that have direct client to database access are 3rd party products that are designed for users to have direct access and are based around giving users permissions.  And yes MS-SQL permission security model SUCKS!!!

<p>Separation -- people would question why you are putting business logic outside of middle tier. Also if you are looking to separate data handling code there are ways of doing that without putting it in the database.</p>

<p>Ability to edit -- What you have no testing and version control you have to worry about?  Also only a problem with client/server, in the web world not problem.</p>

<p>Optimization -- Your DBA should be using the tools of the database to find the queries that need optimization. Database can tell the DBA what statements are talking up the most time and resources and they can fix from there. For complex SQL statements the programmers should be told to talk to the DBA if simple selects don't worry about it.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> that this is a general look at stored procedures not regulated to a specific
  DBMS. Some DBMS (and even, different
  versions of the same DBMS!) may operate
  contrary to this, so you'll want to
  double-check with your target DBMS
  before assuming all of this still holds.</p>
  
  <p>I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-parsed SQL</li>
<li>Pre-generated query execution plan</li>
<li>Reduced network latency</li>
<li>Potential cache benefits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-parsed SQL</strong> -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. </p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em> 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-generated query execution plan</strong>. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the ""near best"" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em> 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.</p>

<p>Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send <code>SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999</code>, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  <code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2</code>. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but
  for further reading see:
  <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx"">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx</a>

  <p>""In summary, they determined that
  supplying anything other than the
  common values when a compile or
  recompile was performed resulted in
  the optimizer compiling and caching
  the query plan for that particular
  value. Yet, when that query plan was
  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (âMâ, âRâ, or âTâ), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the
  query might or might not have a
  performance problem.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reduced network latency</strong>
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple ""exec foobar"" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em>
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?</p>

<p><strong>Potential cache benefits</strong>
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em>
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.</p>

<p>Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Parameterized / Prepared SQL</strong><br />
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses ""parameters"" for query values, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?
</code></pre>

<p>These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Ad Hoc SQL</strong>
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the ""worst"" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.</p>

<p><em>Still a disadvantage?</em>
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to ""abstract"" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx</a> , Oracle: <a href=""http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm"">http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Lessons learned?</strong>
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of <em>massive</em> stored procedure use ** solely for ""performance reasons""** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.</p>

<p>Note that a parameterized query is not the same as ad hoc sql.</p>

<p>The main reason imo to still favor stored procedures today has more to do with security.  If you use stored procedures <em>exclusively</em>, you can disable INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, and CREATE etc permissions for your application's user, only leaving it with EXECUTE.  </p>

","<p>Reasons for using stored procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce network traffic</strong> -- you have to send the SQL statement across the network. With sprocs, you can execute SQL in batches, which is also more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Caching query plan</strong> -- the first time the sproc is executed, SQL Server creates an execution plan, which is cached for reuse. This is particularly performant for small queries run frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to use output parameters</strong> -- if you send inline SQL that returns one row, you can only get back a recordset. With sprocs you can get them back as output parameters, which is considerably faster.</li>
<li><strong>Permissions</strong> -- when you send inline SQL, you have to grant permissions on the table(s) to the user, which is granting much more access than merely granting permission to execute a sproc</li>
<li><strong>Separation of logic</strong> -- remove the SQL-generating code and segregate it in the database.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to edit without recompiling</strong> -- this can be controversial. You can edit the SQL in a sproc without having to recompile the application.</li>
<li><strong>Find where a table is used</strong> -- with sprocs, if you want to find all SQL statements referencing a particular table, you can export the sproc code and search it. This is much easier than trying to find it in code.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization</strong> -- It's easier for a DBA to optimize the SQL and tune the database when sprocs are used. It's easier to find missing indexes and such.</li>
<li><strong>SQL injection attacks</strong> -- properly written inline SQL can defend against attacks, but sprocs are better for this protection.</li>

","<p>I think you can use anything for the ""ID"" as long as you're consistent. Including the table name is important to. I would suggest using a modeling tool like Erwin to enforce the naming conventions and standards so when writing queries it's easy to understand the relationships that may exist between tables. </p>

<p>What I mean by the first statement is, instead of ID you can use something else like 'recno'. So then this table would have a PK of invoice_recno and so on.</p>

","<p>Theres been a nerd fight about this very thing in my company of late.  The advent of LINQ has made the redundant tablename+ID pattern even more obviously silly in my eyes.  I think most reasonable people will say that if you're hand writing your SQL in such a manner as that you have to specify table names to differentiate FKs then it's not only a savings on typing but it adds clarity to your SQL to use just the ID in that you can clearly see which is the PK and which is the FK.</p>

<p>ie.
LEFT JOIN Customers ON Employee.ID = Customer.EmployeeID</p>

<p>tells me not only that the two are linked but which is the PK and which is the FK</p>

","<p>See the Interakt site's <a href=""http://www.interaktonline.com/Support/Articles/Details/Design+Your+Database-Database+Naming+Convention.html?id_art=24&amp;id_asc=221"" rel=""nofollow"">naming conventions</a> for a well thought out system of naming tables and columns. The method makes use of a suffix for each table (<code>_prd</code> for a product table, or <code>_ctg</code> for a category table) and appends that to each column in a given table. So the identity column for the products table would be <code>id_prd</code> and is therefore unique in the database.</p>

<p>They go one step further to help with understanding the foreign keys: The foreign key in the product table that refers to the category table would be <code>idctg_prd</code> so that it is obvious to which table it belong (<code>_prd</code> suffix) and to which table it refers (category).</p>

<p>Advantages are that there is no ambiguity with the identity columns in different tables, and that you can tell at a glance which columns a query is referring to by the column names.</p>

","<p>I prefer DomainName || 'ID'.  (i.e. DomainName + ID)</p>

<p>DomainName is often, but not always, the same as TableName.  </p>

<p>The problem with ID all by itself is that it doesn't scale upwards.  Once you have about 200 tables,  each with a first column named ID, the data begins to look all alike.  If you always qualify ID with the table name,  that helps a little, but not that much.</p>

<p>DomainName &amp; ID can be used to name foreign keys as well as primary keys.  When foriegn keys are named after the column that they reference,  that can be of mnemonic assistance.  Formally, tying the name of a foreign key to the key it references is not necessary, since the referential integrity constrain will establish the reference. But it's awfully handy when it comes to reading queries and updates.  </p>

<p>Occasionally, DomainName || 'ID'   can't be used, because there would be two columns in the same table with the same name.  Example:  Employees.EmployeeID and Employees.SupervisorID.  In those cases,  I use RoleName || 'ID', as in the example.</p>

<p>Last but not least,  I use natural keys rather than synthetic keys when possible.  There are situations where natural keys are unavailable or untrustworthy,  but there are plenty of situations where the natural key is the right choice.  In those cases, I let the natural key take on the name it would naturally have.  This name often doesn't even have the letters, 'ID' in it. Example:  OrderNo  where No is an abbreviation for ""Number"".  </p>

","<p>FWIW, our new standard (which changes, uh, I mean ""evolves"", with every new project) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower case database field names</li>
<li>Uppercase table names</li>
<li>Use underscores to separate words in the field name - convert these to Pascal case in code.</li>
<li><code>pk_</code> prefix means primary key</li>
<li><code>_id</code> suffix means an integer, auto-increment ID</li>
<li><code>fk_</code> prefix means foreign key (no suffix necessary)</li>
<li><code>_VW</code> suffix for views</li>
<li><code>is_</code> prefix for booleans</li>
</ul>

<p>So, a table named NAMES might have the fields <code>pk_name_id, first_name, last_name, is_alive,</code> and <code>fk_company</code> and a view called <code>LIVING_CUSTOMERS_VW</code>, defined like:</p>

<pre>
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM CONTACT.NAMES
WHERE (is_alive = 'True')

","<p>Coming at this from the perspective of a formal data dictionary, I would name the data element <code>invoice_ID</code>. Generally, a data element name will be unique in the data dictionary and ideally will have the same name throughout, though sometimes additional qualifying terms may be required based on context e.g. the data element named <code>employee_ID</code> could be used twice in the org chart and therefore qualified as <code>supervisor_employee_ID</code> and <code>subordinate_employee_ID</code> respectively. </p>

<p>Obviously, naming conventions are subjective and a matter of style. I've find ISO/IEC 11179 guidelines to be a useful starting point.</p>

<p>For the DBMS, I see tables as collections of entites (except those that only ever contain one row e.g. cofig table, table of constants, etc) e.g. the table where my <code>employee_ID</code> is the key would be named <code>Personnel</code>. So straight away the <code>TableNameID</code> convention doesn't work for me.</p>

<p>I've seen the <code>TableName.ID=PK TableNameID=FK</code> style used on large data models and have to say I find it slightly confusing: I much prefer an identifier's name be the same throughout i.e. does not change name based on which table it happens to appear in. Something to note is the aforementioned style seems to be used in the shops which add an <code>IDENTITY</code> (auto-increment) column to <em>every</em> table while shunning natural and compound keys in foreign keys. Those shops tend not to have formal data dictionaries nor build from data models. Again, this is merely a question of style and one to which I don't personally subscribe. So ultimately, it's not for me.</p>

<p>All that said, I can see a case for sometimes dropping the qualifier from the column name when the table's name provides a context for doing so e.g. the element named <code>employee_last_name</code> may become simply <code>last_name</code> in the <code>Personnel</code> table. The rationale here is that the domain is 'people's last names' and is more likely to be <code>UNION</code>ed with <code>last_name</code> columns <em>from</em> other tables rather than be used as a foreign key <em>in</em> another table, but then again... I might just change my mind, sometimes you can never tell. That's the thing: data modelling is part art, part science.</p>

","<p>Definitely the second one.</p>

<p>Parametrized queries have two main advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security: It is a good way to avoid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection"">SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Performance: If you regularly invoke the same query just with different parameters a parametrized query might allow the database to cache your queries which is a considerable source of performance gain.</li>
<li>Extra: You won't have to worry about date and time formatting issues in your database code. Similarly, if your code will ever run on machines with a non-English locale, you will not have problems with decimal points / decimal commas.</li>

","<p>You want to go with your last example as this is the only one that is truly parametrized.  Besides security concerns (which are much more prevalent then you might think) it is best to let ADO.NET handle the parametrization as you cannot be sure if the value you are passing in requires single quotes around it or not without inspecting the <code>Type</code> of each parameter.</p>

<p>[Edit] Here is an example:</p>

","<p>Your EXEC example would NOT be parameterized.  You need parameterized queries (prepared statements in some circles) to prevent input like this from causing damage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>';DROP TABLE bar;--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try putting that in your fuz variable (or don't, if you value your bar table).  More subtle and damaging queries are possible as well.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how you do parameters with Sql Server:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function GetBarFooByBaz(ByVal Baz As String) As String
    Dim sql As String = ""SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz= @Baz""

    Using cn As New SqlConnection(""Your connection string here""), _
        cmd As New SqlCommand(sql, cn)

        cmd.Parameters.Add(""@Baz"", SqlDbType.VarChar, 50).Value = Baz
        Return cmd.ExecuteScalar().ToString()
    End Using
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Stored procedures are sometimes credited with preventing SQL injection.  However, most of the time you still have to call them using query parameters or they don't help.  If you use stored procedures <em>exclusively</em>, then you can turn off permissions for SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, CREATE, DELETE, etc (just about everything but EXEC) for the application user account and get some protection that way.</p>

","<p>SQL formatting is an area where there is a great deal of variance and disagreement... But fwiw, I like to focus on readability and think that whatever you do, consistently conforming to any rules that reduce readability is, as the old cliche goes, a ""foolish consistency""  ( ""Foolish consistency is a hobgoblin for simple minds"" ) </p>

<p>So, instead of calling them rules, here are some guidelines.
For each Major clause in a SQL statement (Select, Insert, Delete, From, Where, Having, Group BY, Order By, ... I may be missing a few) should be EASILY identifiable.  So I generally indent them at the highest level, all even with each other. Then within each clause, I indent the next logical sub structure evenly... and so on.. But I feel free to (and often do) change the pattern if in any individual case it would be more readable to do so... Complex Case statements are a good example.  Because anything that requires horizontal scrolling reduces readability enormously, I often write complex (nested) Case expressions on multiple lines.  When I do, I try to keep the beginning of such a statement hanging indent based on it's logical place in the SQL statement, and indent the rest of the statement lines  a few characters furthur... </p>

<p>SQL Database code has been around for a long time, since before computers had lower case, so there is a historical preference for upper casing keywords, but I prefer readability over tradition... (and every tool I use color codes the key words now anyway)</p>

<p>I also would use Table aliases to reduce the amount of text the eye has to scan in order to grok the structure of the query, as long as the aliases do not create confusion.  In a query with less than 3 or 4 tables, Single character aliases are fine, I often use first letter of the table if all ther tables start with a different letter...  again, whatever most contributes to readability. Finally, if your database supports it,  many of the keywords are optional, (like ""Inner"", ""Outer"", ""As"" for aliases, etc.)   ""Into"" (from Insert Into) is optional on Sql Server - but not on Oracle)  So be careful about using this if your code needs to be platform independant... </p>

<p>Your example, I would write as:</p>

<pre><code>Select column1, column2
From table1 T1
Where column3 In (Select Top(1) column4
                  From table2 T2
                     Join table3 T3
                         On T2.column1 = T3.column1)
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>Select column1, column2
From table1 T1
Where column3 In 
     (Select Top(1) column4
      From table2 T2
         Join table3 T3
            On T2.column1 = T3.column1)
</code></pre>

<p>If there many more columns on the select clause, I would indent the second and subsequent lines... I generally do NOT adhere to any strict (one column per row) kind of rule as scrolling veritcally is almost as bad for readability as scrolling horizontally is,  especially if only the first ten columns of the screen have any text in them)</p>

<pre><code>Select column1, column2, Col3, Col4, column5,
    column6, Column7, isNull(Column8, 'FedEx') Shipper,
    Case Upper(Column9) 
       When 'EAST'  Then 'JFK'
       When 'SOUTH' Then 'ATL'
       When 'WEST'  Then 'LAX'
       When 'NORTH' Then 'CHI' End HubPoint
From table1 T1
Where column3 In 
     (Select Top(1) column4
      From table2 T2
         Join table3 T3
            On T2.column1 = T3.column1)
</code></pre>

<p>Format the code in whatever manner makes it the most readable... </p>

<p>How should this be indented?  Many thanks.</p>
","<p>Well, of course it depends on the query.  </p>

<p>For simple queries, a highly formal indentation scheme is just more trouble than it's worth and can actually make the code <em>less</em> readable, not more.  But as complexity grows you need to start being more careful with how you structure the statement, to make sure it will be readable again later.</p>

Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>
","<p>I'm not really a bright guy and I don't have a lot of experience with the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy method but here's my 2 cents for what it's worth.  I hope it helps you and others (or at least causes people to call out my ignorance ;).</p>

<p>You will never match a raw file copy speed unless your database data file (mdf) is on a separate physical disk from your transaction log file (ldf).  Additionally, any clustered indexes would also need to be on a separate physical disk for a fairer comparison.</p>

<p>Your raw copy is not logging or maintaining a sort order of select fields (columns) for indexing purposes.</p>

<p>I agree with Portman on creating a nonclustered identity seed and changing your existing nonclustered index to a clustered index.</p>

<p>As far as what construct you're using on the clients...(data adapter, dataset, datatable, etc).  If your disk io on the server is at 100%, I don't think your time is best spent analyzing client constructs as they appear to be faster than the server can currently handle.</p>

<p>If you follow Portman's links about minimal logging, I wouldn't think surrounding your bulk copies in transactions would help a lot if any but I've been wrong many times in my life ;)</p>

<p>This won't necessarily help you right now but if you figure out your current issue, this next comment might help with the next bottleneck (network throughput) - especially if it's over the Internet...</p>

<p>Chopeen asked an interesting question too.  How did you determine to use 300 record count chunks to insert?  SQL Server has a default packet size (I believe it is 4096 bytes) and it would make sense to me to derive the size of your records and ensure that you are making efficient use of the packets transmitting between client and server.  (Note, you can change your packet size on your client code as opposed to the server option which would obviously change it for all server communications - probably not a good idea.)  For instance, if your record size results in 300 record batches requiring 4500 bytes, you will send 2 packets with the second packet being mostly wasted.  If batch record count was arbitrarily assigned, it might make sense to do some quick easy math.</p>

<p>From what I can tell (and remember about data type sizes) you have exactly 20 bytes for each record (if int=4 bytes and smallint=2 bytes).  If you are using 300 record count batches, then you are trying to send 300 x 20 = 6,000 bytes (plus I'm guessing a little overhead for the connection, etc).  You might be more efficient to send these up in 200 record count batches (200 x 20 = 4,000 + room for overhead) = 1 packet.  Then again, your bottleneck still appears to be the server's disk io.</p>

<p>I realize you're comparing a raw data transfer to the SqlBulkCopy with the same hardware/configuration but here's where I would go also if the challenge was mine:</p>

<p>This post probably won't help you anymore as it's rather old but I would next ask what your disk's RAID configuration is and what speed of disk are you using?  Try putting the log file on a drive that uses RAID 10 with a RAID 5 (ideally 1) on your data file.  This can help reduce a lot of spindle movement to different sectors on the disk and result in more time reading/writing instead of the unproductive ""moving"" state.  If you already separate your data and log files, do you have your index on a different physical disk drive from your data file (you can only do this with clustered indexes).  That would allow for not only concurrently updating logging information with data inserting but would allow index inserting (and any costly index page operations) to occur concurrently.</p>

","<p>My guess is that you'll see a dramatic improvement if you change that index to be <strong>nonclustered</strong>. This leaves you with two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the index to nonclustered, and leave it as a heap table, without a clustered index</li>
<li>Change the index to nonclustered, but then add a surrogate key (like ""id"") and make it an identity, primary key, and clustered index</li>
</ol>

<p>Either one will speed up your inserts <strong>without</strong> noticeably slowing down your reads. </p>

<p>Think about it this way -- right now, you're telling SQL to do a bulk insert, but then you're asking SQL to reorder the entire table every table you add anything. With a nonclustered index, you'll add the records in whatever order they come in, and then build a separate index indicating their desired order. </p>

","<p>I think that it sounds like this could be done using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms141026.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SSIS packages</a>. They're similar to SQL 2000's DTS packages. I've used them to successfully transform everything from plain text CSV files, from existing SQL tables, and even from XLS files with 6-digit rows spanned across multiple worksheets. You could use C# to transform the data into an importable format (CSV, XLS, etc), then have your SQL server run a scheduled SSIS job to import the data.</p>

<p>It's pretty easy to create an SSIS package, there's a wizard built-into SQL Server's Enterprise Manager tool (labeled ""Import Data"" I think), and at the end of the wizard it gives you the option of saving it as an SSIS package. There's a bunch more info <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/bb671392.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">on Technet</a> as well.</p>

Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>
","<p>You're already using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy.aspx"">SqlBulkCopy</a>, which is a good start.</p>

<p>However, just using the SqlBulkCopy class does not necessarily mean that SQL will perform a bulk copy. In particular, there are a few requirements that must be met for SQL Server to perform an efficient bulk insert.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, why is your index set up like that? It seems like ContainerId/BinId/Sequence is <strong>much</strong> better suited to be a nonclustered index. Is there a particular reason you wanted this index to be clustered?</p>

","<p>Have you tried using transactions?</p>

<p>From what you describe, having the server committing 100% of the time to disk, it seems you are sending each row of data in an atomic SQL sentence thus forcing the server to commit (write to disk) every single row.</p>

<p>If you used transactions instead, the server would only commit <em>once</em> at the end of the transaction.</p>

<p>For further help: What method are you using for inserting data to the server? Updating a DataTable using a DataAdapter, or executing each sentence using a string?</p>

<p>Here it shows that the name of the missing table and the line number in the SQL statement where the error occurs.</p>

<p>Similarly, in a one-line SQL statement you can see the asterisk highlighting the name of the unknown table:</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; select * from user_tables a, non_existent_table b where a.table_name = b.table_name;
select * from user_tables a, non_existent_table b where a.table_name = b.table_name

ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

<p>In terms of your question, I guess the reason the error message doesn't include the name of the table is that the error message itself needs to be static text. The line number and location in the line of the error is clearly passed back to SQL*Plus (somehow).</p>

So, even though one piece of code might not look as tidy or elegant as another, it could be significantly more efficient.

<p>This will return values in the order you gave in your question.</p>

<p>Performance won't be too great with all that casting going on, so another approach is to add another column to the table in which you store an integer copy of the data and then sort by that first and then the column in question. This will obviously require some changes to the logic that inserts or updates data in the table, to populate both columns. Either that, or put a trigger on the table to populate the second column whenever data is inserted or updated.</p>

","<p>If you're trying to get it in one statement (the total plus the paging).  You might need to explore SQL Server support for the partition by clause (windowing functions in ANSI SQL terms).  In Oracle the syntax is just like the example above using row_number(), but I have also added a partition by clause to get the total number of rows included with each row returned in the paging (total rows is 1,262):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT rn, total_rows, x.OWNER, x.object_name, x.object_type
  FROM (SELECT COUNT (*) OVER (PARTITION BY owner) AS TOTAL_ROWS,
               ROW_NUMBER () OVER (ORDER BY 1) AS rn, uo.*
          FROM all_objects uo
         WHERE owner = 'CSEIS') x
 WHERE rn BETWEEN 6 AND 10
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I have where owner = 'CSEIS' and my partition by is on owner.  So the results are:</p>

<pre><code>RN  TOTAL_ROWS  OWNER   OBJECT_NAME OBJECT_TYPE

","<p>Here's what I do for paging:  All of my big queries that need to be paged are coded as inserts into a temp table.  The temp table has an identity field that will act in a similar manner to the row_number() mentioned above.  I store the number of rows in the temp table in an output parameter so the calling code knows how many total records there are.  The calling code also specifies which page it wants, and how many rows per page, which are selected out from the temp table.</p>

<p>The cool thing about doing it this way is that I also have an ""Export"" link that allows you to get all rows from the report returned as CSV above every grid in my application.  This link uses the same stored procedure: you just return the contents of the temp table instead of doing the paging logic.  This placates users who hate paging, and want to see <em>everything</em>, and want to sort it in a million different ways.</p>

","<p>Indexes is a method which database systems use to quickly find data.  The real world analogy are indexes in books.  If an author/publisher does a good job at indexing their book, it becomes pretty easy for the reader to directly go to the page they want to read simply by looking at the index.  Same goes for a database.  If an index is created on a field, the database pre-sorts the data.  When a request is made on the data, the database uses the index to identify which location the data is stored in on the hard disk, and directly goes there.  If there are no indexes, the database needs to look at every record in order to find out if it meets the criteria(s) of your query.</p>

<p>A simple way to look at indexes is by thinking of a deck of cards.  A database which is not indexed is like a deck a cards which have been shuffled.  If you want to find the king of spades, you need to look at every card one by one to find it.  You might be lucky and it can be the first one, or you might be unlucky and it can be the last one.  </p>

<p>A database which is indexed, has all the cards in the deck ordered from ace to king and each suite is set aside in its own pile.  Looking for the king of spades is much simpler now because you simply need to look at the bottom of the pile of cards which contains the spades.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.  Be warned though that although indexes are necessary in a relational database system, they can counter productive if you write too many of them.  There's a ton of great articles on the web that you can read up on indexes.  I'd suggest doing some reading before you dive into them.</p>

","<p>Some more index information!</p>

<p>Clustered indexes are the actual physical layout of the records in the table. Hence, you can only have one per table.</p>

<p>Nonclustered indexes are the aforementioned card catalog.  Sure, the books are arranged in a particular order, but you can arrange the cards in the catalog by book size, or maybe by number of pages, or by alphabetical last name.</p>

<p>Something to think about -- creating too many indexes is a common pitfall.  Every time your data gets updated your DB has to seek through that index and update it, inserting a record into every index on that table for that new row.  In transactional systems (think: NYSE's stock transactions!) that could be an application killer.</p>

","<p>As a rule of thumb, indexes should be on any fields that you use in joins or where clauses (if they have enough different values to make using an index worthwhile, field with only a few possible values doesn't benefit from an index which is why it is pointless to try to index a bit field). </p>

<p>If your structure has formally created primary keys (which it should, I never create a table without a primary key), those are by definition indexed becasue a primary key is required to have a unique index on it. People often forget that they have to index the foreign keys becasue an index is not automatically created when you set up the foreign key relationsship.  Since the purpose of a foreign key is to give you a field to join on, most foreign keys should probably be indexed.</p>

<p>Indexes once created need to be maintained. If you have a lot of data change activity, they can get fragmented and slow performance and need to be refreshed. Read in Books online about indexes. You can also find the syntax for the create index statement there.</p>

<p>Indexes are a balancing act, every index you add usually will add time to data inserts, updates and deletes but can potentially speed up selects and joins in complex inserts, updates and deletes. There is no one formula for what are the best indexes although the rule of thumb above is a good place to start.</p>

","<p>As previously stated, you can have a clustered index and multiple non-clustered indexes.  In SQL 2005, you can also add additional columns to a non-clustered index, which can improve performance where a few commonly retrieved columns are included with the index but not part of the key, which eliminates a trip to the table altogether.</p>

<p>Your #1 tool for determining what your SQL Server database is doing is the profiler.  You can profile entire workloads and then see what indexes it recommends.  You can also look at execution plans to see what effects an index has.</p>

<p>The too-many indexes problem is due to writing into a database, and having to update all the indexes which would have a record for that row.  If you're having read performance, it's probably not because of too many indexes, but too few, or too unsuitable.</p>

","<p>Not a big fan of views (Can't remember the last time I wrote one) but wouldn't ban them entirely either. If your database allows you to put indexes on the views and not just on the table, you can often improve performance a good bit which makes them better. If you are using views, make sure to look into indexing them.</p>

<p>I really only see the need for views for partitioning data and for extremely complex joins that are really critical to the application (thinking of financial reports here where starting from the same dataset for everything might be critical). I do know some reporting tools seem to prefer views over stored procs.</p>

<p>I am a big proponent of never returning more records or fields than you need in a specific instance and the overuse of views tends to make people return more fields (and in way too many cases, too many joins) than they need which wastes system resources. </p>

<p>I also tend to see that people who rely on views (not the developer of the view - the people who only use them) often don't understand the database very well (so they would get the joins wrong if not using the view) and that to me is critical to writing good code against the database. I want people to understand what they are asking the db to do, not rely on some magic black box of a view. That is all personal opinion of course, your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Like BlaM I personally haven't found them easier to maintain than stored procs.</p>

<p>Edited in Oct 2010 to add:
Since I orginally wrote this, I have had occasion to work with a couple of databases designed by people who were addicted to using views. Even worse they used views that called views that called views (to the point where eventually we hit the limit of the number of tables that can be called). This was a performance nightmare. It took 8 minutes to get a simple count(*) of the records in one view and much longer to get data. If you use views, be very wary of using views that call other views. You will be building a system that will very probably not work under the normal performance load on production. In SQL Server you can only index views that do not call other views, so what ends up happening when you use views in a chain, is that the entire record set has to be built for each view and it is not until you get to the last one that the where clause criteria are applied. You may need to generate millions of records just to see three. You may join to the same table 6 times when you really only need to join to it once, you may return many many more columns than you need in the final results set. </p>

","<p>Views are good for ad-hoc queries, the kind that a DBA does behind the scenes when he/she needs quick access to data to see what's going on with the system.</p>

<p>But they can be bad for production code.  Part of the reason is that it's sort of unpredictable what indexes you will need with a view, since the where clause can be different, and therefore hard to tune.  Also, you are generally returning a lot more data than is actually necesary for the individual queries that are using the view.  Each of these queries could be tightened up and tuned individually.</p>

<p>There are specific uses of views in cases of data partitioning that can be extremely useful, so I'm not saying they should avoided altogether.  I'm just saying that if a view can be replaced by a few stored procedures, you will be better off without the view.</p>

<p>I usually prefer working with tables directly, especially for web applications where speed is a main concern. When accessing tables directly you have the chance to tweak your SQL-Queries to achieve the best performance. ""Precompiled""/cached working plans might be one advantage of views, but in many cases just-in-time compilation with all given parameters and where clauses in consideration will result in faster processing over all.</p>

<p>However that does not rule out views totally, if used adequately. For example you can use a view with the ""users"" table joined with the ""users_status"" table to get an textual explanation for each status - if you need it. However if you don't need the explanation: use the ""users"" table, not the view. As always: Use your brain!</p>

","<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that index choice should be based on cardinality.  They'll say, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a <em>low cardinality</em> column like GENDER, use bitmap.  For a <em>high cardinality</em> like LAST_NAME, use b-tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is not the case with Oracle</strong>, where index choice should instead be based on the type of application (OLTP vs. OLAP).  DML on tables with bitmap indexes can cause serious lock contention.  On the other hand, the Oracle CBO can easily combine multiple bitmap indexes together, and bitmap indexes can be used to search for nulls.  As a general rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For an <em>OLTP</em> system with frequent DML and routine queries, use btree.  For an <em>OLAP</em> system with infrequent DML and adhoc queries, use bitmap.</p>

","<p>Not deleting will create a new class of bugs for all future queries.  Don't forget that query writing is often done by power users (i.e. non-IT professionals), and junior developers.  So now every table that has invalid data marked only by a BIT active flag will need an additional AND in the WHERE clause for every query from now until forever.  This will help users fall into the pit of failure instead of the pit of success.  However, I strongly encourage you to implement these flag systems anyhow because without bad design, there is no need for maintenance developers to fix the numerous bugs it will create.</p>

<p>How valuable is it to have historical data in the table?  If the business if forward looking, having old data in the tables can just be a burden-- it cause problems when creating constraints (all constraints will have to be modified to exclude data you wish wasn't there).  Data quality assurance is complicated by having to continually re-identify what is ""old crap we are afraid to delete but never want to ever use or update again"" and new stuff we care about.</p>

<p>Is it being deleted because it was a mistake?  If the row corresponds to an entity in real life, maybe it is interesting to keep and set a ""vaporized"", ""dead"", ""left the building"" flag.  If you accidentally inserted a row that corresponds to no entity in real life, a DELETE is not a bad thing.  Are imaginary customers that never existed important to keep in the customer table?</p>

<p>And finally, personality plays a big role.  People can be packrats with data, too.  If a DBA keeps all his newspapers from 30 years back and don't like deleting data, maybe he should make sure he's making data design decisions based on the merits and not an irrelevant personal preference.</p>

","<p>Adding a ""DELETED"" column to your table and marking rows instead of deleting them creates a lot more work for you with little (if any) benefit.  Now, every time you write a query you have to remember to include ""WHERE DELETED IS NOT NULL"" (or whatever).</p>

<p>A better approach is to delete data when you need to delete data, and rely on your regular backup process to ensure that no data is ever lost.  If for some reason you need to keep some deleted data handy (for searches, maybe), you're better off just copying the data to a different table created for this purpose and then deleting the originals.</p>

<p>I've inherited many databases over the years, and this strategy of flagging records instead of deleting them is unfortunately very common, and (in my experience at least) always leads to major problems down the road.</p>

","<p>It depends. (But you guessed that already, I'm sure.)  </p>

<p>In practice, the violation of proper usage here is almost always in the direction of deleting.  </p>

<p>The main bad consequence of deleting is how often there are dependent records in other tables whose referential integrity is lost when the parent record goes away.</p>

<p>One red herring used to defend deletion (which you've already dealt with properly by dismissing the issue of storage capacity), is expecting that it will make any noticeable difference in query efficiency.</p>

<p>There are too many cases where user or software issues cause someone to need to hit the big ""Undo"" button; if you delete, you're out of luck (at least without getting special help and aggravating people you'd rather be nice to.)</p>

<p>The terminology I usually use is ""Active"" and ""Inactive"".</p>

","<p>After reading a book on temporal database design, I came to believe in the philosophy that every record of temporal significance needs to have at least 4 timestamp columns.  Those four are: created, deleted, start, end.  The created and deleted timestamps are fairly self-explanatory.  Your system shouldn't look at records where deleted is before now().  The start and end columns determine when the data applies to your system.  It's for keeping a history of changes.  If you need to update a record, you'd set it's end time to now(), copy it, update the copy, and set the copy's start time to now().  That way, when you need to look at the way something was historically, you can have the system figure it out.  You could also set the start to some point in the future to have a change take place automatically at that time, or set the end to a future time to have it automatically go away at that time.  Setting the created/deleted timestamps to the future doesn't really make sense...</p>

","<p>This should be determined by the application needs.  I have done it both ways.  I have some applications that need to support undo as the cost of removing a row -- and the cascading deletes that are caused by that -- are too expensive to not have it.  Normally, though, the applications I have done require the user to confirm deletes, then just do as the user has asked.  In some cases, you must delete the data due to privacy concerns.  That is, if the user requests to be removed, you need to really remove it, not just mark it as not current.  In other cases (like tax-related transactions), there may be reasons to keep data in a non-current state until no longer required by law.  I have applications that fit in both categories.</p>

<p>Various strategies can be used in the case where you need to keep ""archival"" data.  Depending on whether it needs to be immediately available you can push it to archive tables that are either kept or backed up and cleaned out regularly.   If there is a need for undo you may want to keep it in the current table and just mark it by setting a flag.  It really depends on the complexity of your schema, the requirements of the application, and personal preference to some extent.</p>

","<p>LINQ is not about SQL. LINQ is about being apply functional programming paradigmns on objects.</p>

<p>LINQ to SQL is an ORM built ontop of the LINQ foundation, but LINQ is much more. I don't use LINQ to SQL, yet I use LINQ all the time.</p>

<p>Take the task of finding the intersection of two lists:</p>

<p>Before LINQ, this tasks requires writing a nested foreach that iterates the small list once for every item in the big list O(N*M), and takes about 10 lines of code.</p>

{
    foreach (int number2 in list2)

","<p>LINQ is not just an ORM system, as Jonathan pointed out it brings a lot of functional programming elements to C#. And it lets you do a lot of ""database-y"" things in regular C# code. It's difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be. Consider how much having solid, well designed generic data structures (such as list, stack, dictionary/hash, etc.) included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages. Precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit. LINQ doesn't do anything you can't do yourself, but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier.</p>

<p>Consider the time-honored example of removing duplicates from a non-ordered list. In a lower level language like C or C++ you'd probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes. In a language with hashes (Java, C#, Javascript, Perl, etc.) you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values, then extract the keys into a new list. With LINQ you could just do this:</p>

<pre><code>int[] data = { 0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2, 1 };

var uniqueData = data.GroupBy(i =&gt; i).Select(g =&gt; g.Key);

","<p>Your query is not wrapped in a transaction, so it won't rollback the changes already made by the individual delete statements.</p>

<p>I specifically tested this myself on my own SQL Server using the following query, and the ApplicationLog table was empty even though I cancelled the query:</p>

<pre><code>declare @count int
select @count = 5
WHILE @count &gt; 0
BEGIN
  print @count
  delete from applicationlog;
  waitfor time '20:00';
  select @count = @count -1
END

<p>However your query is likely to take many days or weeks, much longer then 15 hours.  Your estimate that you can process 2000 records every 6 seconds is wrong because each iteration in your while loop will take significantly longer with 17 million rows then it does with 2000 rows.  So unless your query takes significantly less then a second for 2000 rows, it will take days for all 17 million.</p>

<p>You should ask a new question on how you can delete duplicate rows efficiently.</p>

","<p>no, sql server will not roll back the deletes it has already performed if you stop query execution. oracle requires an explicit committal of action queries or the data gets rolled back, but not mssql.</p>

<p>with sql server it will not roll back unless you are specifically running in the context of a transaction and you rollback that transaction, or the connection closes without the transaction having been committed. but i don't see a transaction context in your above query.</p>

<p>you could also try re-structuring your query to make the deletes a little more efficient, but essentially if the specs of your box are not up to snuff then you might be stuck waiting it out.</p>

","<p>I inherited a system which had logic something like yours implemented in SQL.   In our case, we were trying to link together rows using fuzzy matching that had similar names/addresses, etc, and that logic was done purely in SQL.   At the time I inherited it we had about 300,000 rows in the table and according to the timings, we calculated it would take A YEAR to match them all.</p>

<p>As an experiment to see how much faster I could do it outside of SQL, I wrote a program to dump the db table into flat files, read the flat files into a C++ program, build my own indexes, and do the fuzzy logic there, then reimport the flat files into the database.   What took A YEAR in SQL took about 30 seconds in the C++ app.</p>

<p>So, my advice is, don't even try what you are doing in SQL.   Export, process, re-import.</p>

I have set of SQL Server tables that I'm querying based on a simple user-supplied search field ala Google. I'm using LINQ to compose the final query based on what's in the search string. I'm looking for a way to use generics and passed in lambda functions to create a reusable routine out of this: </p>

<pre><code>string[] arrayOfQueryTerms = getsTheArray();

var somequery = from q in dataContext.MyTable
                select q;

if (arrayOfQueryTerms.Length == 1)
{
    somequery = somequery.Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(
        e =&gt; e.FieldName.StartsWith(arrayOfQueryTerms[0]));
}
else
{
    foreach(string queryTerm in arrayOfQueryTerms)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(queryTerm))
        {
            somequery = somequery 
                        .Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(

        }
    }

<pre><code>private IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getQuery(
    T MyTableEntity, string[] arrayOfQueryTerms, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the same search strategy across all my tables, so the only thing that really differs from usage to usage is the MyTable &amp; MyTableEntity searched and the FieldName searched. Does this make sense? Is there a way with LINQ to dynamically pass in the name of the field to query in the where clause? Or can I pass in this as a predicate lambda?</p>

<pre><code>e =&gt; e.FieldName.Contains(queryTerm)
</code></pre>

<p>I realize there a million and a half ways to do this in SQL, probably easier, but I'd love to keep everything in the LINQ family for this one. Also, I feel that generics should be handy for a problem like this. Any ideas?</p>

277,125400,0,17,sql,Generic LINQ query predicate?,"<p>Not sure if this is possible or if I'm expressing correctly what I'm looking for, but I have the following piece of code in my library repeatedly and would like to practice some DRY. 
I have set of SQL Server tables that I'm querying based on a simple user-supplied search field ala Google. I'm using LINQ to compose the final query based on what's in the search string. I'm looking for a way to use generics and passed in lambda functions to create a reusable routine out of this: </p>

<pre><code>string[] arrayOfQueryTerms = getsTheArray();

var somequery = from q in dataContext.MyTable
                select q;

if (arrayOfQueryTerms.Length == 1)
{
    somequery = somequery.Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(
        e =&gt; e.FieldName.StartsWith(arrayOfQueryTerms[0]));
}
else
{
    foreach(string queryTerm in arrayOfQueryTerms)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(queryTerm))
        {
            somequery = somequery 
                        .Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(

Does this make sense? Is there a way with LINQ to dynamically pass in the name of the field to query in the where clause? Or can I pass in this as a predicate lambda?</p>

<pre><code>e =&gt; e.FieldName.Contains(queryTerm)

","<p>A SQL query is basically a functional unit designed by a programmer for use in some context. For long-term stability and supportability (possibly by someone other than you) everything in a functional unit should be there for a purpose, and it should be reasonably evident (or documented) why it's there - especially every element of data.</p>

<p>If I were to come along two years from now with the need or desire to alter your query, I would expect to grok it pretty thoroughly before I would be confident that I could mess with it. Which means I would need to understand why all the columns are called out. (This is even more obviously true if you are trying to reuse the query in more than one context. Which is problematic in general, for similar reasons.) If I were to see columns in the output that I couldn't relate to some purpose, I'd be pretty sure that I didn't understand what it did, and why, and what the consequences would be of changing it.</p>

","<p>Using <code>SELECT *</code> within the view does not incur much of a performance overhead if columns aren't used outside the view - the optimizer will optimize them out; <code>SELECT * FROM TheView</code> can perhaps waste bandwidth, just like any time you pull more columns across a network connection.</p>

<p>In fact, I have found that views which link almost all the columns from a number of huge tables in my datawarehouse have not introduced any performance issues at all, even through relatively few of those columns are requested from outside the view.  The optimizer handles that well and is able to push the external filter criteria down into the view very well.</p>

<p>However, for all the reasons given above, I very rarely use <code>SELECT *</code>.</p>

<p>I have some business processes where a number of CTEs are built on top of each other, effectively building derived columns from derived columns from derived columns (which will hopefully one day being refactored as the business rationalizes and simplifies these calculations), and in that case, I need all the columns to drop through each time, and I use <code>SELECT *</code> - but <code>SELECT *</code> is not used at the base layer, only in between the first CTE and the last.</p>

","<p>Although many of the comments here are very good and reference one common problem of using wildcards in queries, such as causing errors or different results if the underlying tables change, another issue that hasn't been covered is optimization.  A query that pulls every column of a table tends to not be quite as efficient as a query that pulls only those columns you actually need.  Granted, there are those times when you need every column and it's a major PIA having to reference them all, especially in a large table, but if you only need a subset, why bog down your query with more columns than you need.</p>

","<p>Another reason why ""<code>*</code>"" is risky, not only in views but in queries, is that columns can change name or change position in the underlying tables.  Using a wildcard means that your view accommodates such changes easily without needing to be changed.

<p>I avoid using the wildcard at all times.  That way if a column changes name, I get an error in the view or query immediately, and I know where to fix it.  If a column changes position in the underlying table, specifying the order of the columns in the view or query compensates for this.</p>

275,125400,14,17,sql,Generic LINQ query predicate?,"<p>Not sure if this is possible or if I'm expressing correctly what I'm looking for, but I have the following piece of code in my library repeatedly and would like to practice some DRY. 
I have set of SQL Server tables that I'm querying based on a simple user-supplied search field ala Google. I'm using LINQ to compose the final query based on what's in the search string. I'm looking for a way to use generics and passed in lambda functions to create a reusable routine out of this: </p>

<pre><code>string[] arrayOfQueryTerms = getsTheArray();

var somequery = from q in dataContext.MyTable
                select q;

if (arrayOfQueryTerms.Length == 1)
{
    somequery = somequery.Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(
        e =&gt; e.FieldName.StartsWith(arrayOfQueryTerms[0]));
}
else
{
    foreach(string queryTerm in arrayOfQueryTerms)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(queryTerm))
        {
            somequery = somequery 
                        .Where&lt;MyTableEntity&gt;(
                            e =&gt; e.FieldName.Contains(queryTerm));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping to create a generic method with signature that looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>private IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getQuery(
    T MyTableEntity, string[] arrayOfQueryTerms, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the same search strategy across all my tables, so the only thing that really differs from usage to usage is the MyTable &amp; MyTableEntity searched and the FieldName searched. Does this make sense? Is there a way with LINQ to dynamically pass in the name of the field to query in the where clause? Or can I pass in this as a predicate lambda?</p>

<pre><code>e =&gt; e.FieldName.Contains(queryTerm)
</code></pre>

<p>I realize there a million and a half ways to do this in SQL, probably easier, but I'd love to keep everything in the LINQ family for this one. Also, I feel that generics should be handy for a problem like this. Any ideas?</p>

","<p>Unless technology has improved in ways I can't imagine of late, the ""IN"" query shown will produce a result that's effectively the OR-ing of three result sets, one for each of the values in the ""IN"" list. The IN clause becomes an equality condition for each of the list and will use an index if appropriate. In the case of unique IDs and a large enough table then I'd expect the optimiser to use an index.</p>

<p>If the items in the list were to be non-unique however, and I guess in the example that a ""TypeId"" is a foreign key, then I'm more interested in the distribution. I'm wondering if the optimiser will check the stats for each value in the list? Say it checks the first value and finds it's in 20% of the rows (of a large enough table to matter). It'll probably table scan. But will the same query plan be used for the other two, even if they're unique?</p>

<p>It's probably moot - something like an Employee table is likely to be small enough that it will stay cached in memory and you probably wouldn't notice a difference between that and indexed retrieval anyway.</p>

<p>And lastly, while I'm preaching, beware the query in the IN clause: it's often a quick way to get something working and (for me at least) can be a good way to express the requirement, but it's almost always better restated as a join. Your optimiser may be smart enough to spot this, but then again it may not. If you don't currently performance-check against production data volumes, do so - in these days of cost-based optimisation you can't be certain of the query plan until you have a full load and representative statistics.

","<p>Yeah, that's right.  If your employee table has 10,000 records, and only 5 records have employeetypeID in (1,2,3), then it will most likely use the index to fetch the records.  However, if it finds that 9,000 records have the employeeIDType in (1,2,3), then it would most likely just do a table scan to get the corresponding EmployeeIDs, as it's faster just to run through the whole table than to go to each branch of the index tree and look at the records individually.  </p>

<p>SQL Server does a lot of stuff to try and optimize how the queries run.  However, sometimes it doesn't get the right answer.  If you know that SQL Server isn't using the index, by looking at the execution plan in query analyzer, you can tell the query engine to use a specific index with the following change to your query.</p>

  <p>So there's the potential for an ""IN"" clause to run a table scan, but the optimizer will

<p>Whether an index is used doesn't so much vary on the type of query as much of the type and distribution of data in the table(s), how up-to-date your table statistics are, and the actual datatype of the column.</p>

<p>The other posters are correct that an index will be used over a table scan if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The query won't access more than a certain percent of the rows indexed (say ~10% but should vary between DBMS's).</li>
<li>Alternatively, if there are a lot of rows, but relatively few unique values in the column, it also may be faster to do a table scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other variable that might not be that obvious is making sure that the datatypes of the values being compared are the same. In PostgreSQL, I don't think that indexes will be used if you're filtering on a float but your column is made up of ints. There are also some operators that don't support index use (again, in PostgreSQL, the ILIKE operator is like this).</p>

924,430830,15,14,sql,Prevent mutually recursive execution of triggers?,"<p>Suppose you have the tables <code>Presentations</code> and <code>Events</code>. When a presentation is saved and contains basic event information, such as location and date, an event will be created automatically using a trigger. (I'm afraid it's impossible for technical reasons to simply keep the data at one place and use a view.) In addition, when changing this information later on in the presentation, the trigger will copy the updates over to the event as well, like so:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER update_presentations
ON Presentations
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Events
    SET Events.Date = Presentations.Date,
        Events.Location = Presentations.Location
    FROM Presentations INNER JOIN Events ON Presentations.EventID = Events.ID
    WHERE Presentations.ID IN (SELECT ID FROM inserted)
END
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the customer wants it so that, if a user ever changes the information in the <em>event</em>, it should go back to the presentation as well. For obvious reasons, I can't do the reverse:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER update_events
ON Events
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Presentations
    SET Presentations.Date = Events.Date,
        Presentations.Location = Events.Location
    FROM Events INNER JOIN Presentations ON Events.PresentationID = Presentations.ID
    WHERE Events.ID IN (SELECT ID FROM inserted)
END
</code></pre>

<p>After all, this would cause each trigger to fire after each other. What I could do is add a column <code>last_edit_by</code> to both tables, containing a user ID. If filled by the trigger with a special invalid ID (say, by making all user IDs of actual persons positive, but user IDs of scripts negative), I could use that as an exit condition:</p>

<pre><code>    AND last_edit_by &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>This might work, but what I'd like to do is indicate to the SQL server that, within a transaction, a trigger should only fire once. Is there a way to check this? Or perhaps to check that a table has already been affected by a trigger?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong> thanks to Steve Robbins:</p>

<p>Just wrap the potentially nested <code>UPDATE</code> statements in an IF condition checking for <code>trigger_nestlevel()</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER update_presentations
ON Presentations
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    IF trigger_nestlevel() &lt; 2
        UPDATE Events
        SET Events.Date = Presentations.Date,
            Events.Location = Presentations.Location
        FROM Presentations INNER JOIN Events ON Presentations.EventID = Events.ID
        WHERE Presentations.ID IN (SELECT ID FROM inserted)
END
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>trigger_nestlevel()</code> appears to be 1-based, not 0-based. If you want each of the two triggers to execute once, but not more often, just check for <code>trigger_nestlevel() &lt; 3</code> in both triggers.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure about doing it per transaction, but do you need nested triggers switched on for other parts? If you switch them off on the server then a trigger won't fire from another trigger updating a table.</p>

<p><strong>How can I write a query that will sort by lexicographic order?</strong> </p>

<p>... or,</p>

<p><strong>How can I correctly sort the data?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the input in advance!</p>
","<p>You could split up the string (you already know the delimiters: ""."") with CHARINDEX / SUBSTR and ORDER BY the different parts. Do it in a function or do it part by part.</p>

<p>It won't be pretty and it won't be fast: so if you need fast queries, follow Tony or Joel.</p>

","<p>First off, you need to enabled Full text Searching indexing on the production servers, so if thats not in scope, your not going to want to go with this.</p>

<p>However, if that's already ready to go, full text searching is relatively simple.</p>

<p>T-SQL has 4 predicates used for full text search:</p>

<ul>
<li>FREETEXT</li>
<li>FREETEXTTABLE</li>
<li>CONTAINS</li>
<li>CONTAINSTABLE</li>
</ul>

<p>FREETEXT is the simplest, and can be done like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT UserName
FROM Tbl_Users
WHERE FREETEXT (UserName, 'bob' )

Results:

JimBob
Little Bobby Tables
</code></pre>

<p>FREETEXTTABLE works the same as FreeTEXT, except it returns the results as a table.</p>

<p>The real power of T-SQL's full text search comes from the CONTAINS (and CONTAINSTABLE) predicate...This one is huge, so I'll just paste its usage in:</p>

<pre><code>CONTAINS
    ( { column | * } , '&lt; contains_search_condition &gt;' 
    ) 

&lt; contains_search_condition &gt; ::= 
        { &lt; simple_term &gt; 
        | &lt; prefix_term &gt; 
        | &lt; generation_term &gt; 
        | &lt; proximity_term &gt; 
        | &lt; weighted_term &gt; 
        } 
        | { ( &lt; contains_search_condition &gt; ) 
        { AND | AND NOT | OR } &lt; contains_search_condition &gt; [ ...n ] 
        } 

&lt; simple_term &gt; ::= 
    word | "" phrase ""

&lt; prefix term &gt; ::= 
    { ""word * "" | ""phrase * "" }

&lt; generation_term &gt; ::= 
    FORMSOF ( INFLECTIONAL , &lt; simple_term &gt; [ ,...n ] ) 

&lt; proximity_term &gt; ::= 
    { &lt; simple_term &gt; | &lt; prefix_term &gt; } 
    { { NEAR | ~ } { &lt; simple_term &gt; | &lt; prefix_term &gt; } } [ ...n ] 

&lt; weighted_term &gt; ::= 
    ISABOUT 
        ( { { 
                &lt; simple_term &gt; 
                | &lt; prefix_term &gt; 
                | &lt; generation_term &gt; 
                | &lt; proximity_term &gt; 
                } 
            [ WEIGHT ( weight_value ) ] 
            } [ ,...n ] 
        )
</code></pre>

<p>This means you can write queries such as:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT UserName
FROM Tbl_Users
WHERE CONTAINS(UserName, '""little*"" NEAR tables')

Results:

Little Bobby Tables
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck :)</p>

","<p>I've been there. It works like a charm until you start to consider scalability and advanced search functionalities like search over multiple columns with giving each one different weight values.</p>

<p>For example, the only way to search over <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Summary</strong> columns is to have a computed column with <code>SearchColumn = CONCAT(Title, Summary)</code> and index over <code>SearchColumn</code>. Weighting? <code>SearchColumn = CONCAT(CONCAT(Title,Title), Summary)</code> something like that. ;) Filtering? Forget about it.</p>

","<p>I've had the same problem, though mine was with apartment numbers like A1, A2, A3, A10, A11, etc, that they wanted to sort ""right"".  If splitting up the version number into separate columns doesn't work, try this PL/SQL.  It takes a string like A1 or A10and expands it into A0000001, A0000010, etc, so it sorts nicely.  Just call this in ORDER BY clause, like</p>

<p>select apt_num
from apartment
order by PAD(apt_num)</p>

<pre><code>function pad(inString IN VARCHAR2)
   return VARCHAR2

--This function pads the numbers in a alphanumeric string.
--It is particularly useful in sorting, things like ""A1, A2, A10""
--which would sort like ""A1, A10, A2"" in a standard ""ORDER BY name"" clause
--but by calling ""ORDER BY pkg_sort.pad(name)"" it will sort as ""A1, A2, A10"" because this
--function will convert it to ""A00000000000000000001, A00000000000000000002, A00000000000000000010"" 
--(but since this is in the order by clause, it will
--not be displayed.

--currently, the charTemplate variable pads the number to 20 digits, so anything up to 99999999999999999999 
--will work correctly.
--to increase the size, just change the charTemplate variable.  If the number is larger than 20 digits, it will just
--appear without padding.

","<p>I don't recommend doing this as each time it is created a new execution plan must be calculated, but YES, it definitely can be done (Everything is possible, but not always recommended).</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROC [dbo].[sp_helloworld]
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 'Hello World'
    DECLARE @sSQL VARCHAR(1000)
    SET @sSQL = 'CREATE PROC [dbo].[sp_helloworld2]
    		AS
    		BEGIN
    			SELECT ''Hello World 2''
    		END'
    EXEC (@sSQL)

    EXEC [sp_helloworld2];
    DROP PROC [sp_helloworld2];
END
</code></pre>

<p>You will get the warning</p>

<pre><code>The module 'sp_helloworld' depends on the missing object 'sp_helloworld2'.
The module will still be created; however, it cannot run successfully until
the object exists.
</code></pre>

<p>You can bypass this warning by using EXEC('sp_helloworld2') above.</p>

<p>But if you call EXEC [sp_helloworld] you will get the results</p>

<pre><code>Hello World
Hello World 2

","<p>The version of Visio that comes with VS Enterprise Architect has a forward-engineer feature that will generate SQL.  There is also a type library for the modelling engine, but (on older versions at least) it won't extract certain items such as comments.  However, the generated SQL has the comments in a fairly simple structure that does facilitate parsing the generated SQL.</p>

<p>One caveat for reverse-engineers is that all pre-VS2005 visio DB modelling engines will not play nicely with the SQL Server 2005 native client.  You need to either script out the database and re-load it on a SQL2000 server (dealing with SQL2005 specific features such as schemas is left as an exercise for the reader) or get a more recent version.</p>

","<p>Oracle's PL/SQL is something of a special case, being a language heavily based on Ada, rather than simple DML with some procedural constructs bolted on. Whether or not you think this is a good idea probably depends on your appetite for procedural code in your DBMS and your liking for learning complex new languages.</p>

<p>The idea of a subroutine, to reduce duplication or otherwise, is largely foreign to other database platforms in my experience (Oracle, MS SQL, Sybase, MySQL, SQLite in the main).</p>

<p>While the SQL-building proc would work, I think John's right in suggesting that you don't use his otherwise-correct answer!</p>

<p>You don't say what form your repeated lines take, so I'll offer three potential alternatives, starting with the simplest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do nothing. Accept that procedural
SQL is a primitive language lacking
so many ""essential"" constructs that
you wouldn't use it at all if it
wasn't the only option.</p></li>
<li><p>Move your procedural operations outside of the DBMS and execute them in code written in a more sophisticated language. Consider ways in which your architecture could be adjusted to extract business logic from your data storage platform (hey, why not redesign the whole thing!)</p></li>
<li><p>If the repetition is happening in DML, SELECTs in particular, consider introducing views to slim down the queries.</p></li>
<li><p>Write code to generate, as part of your build process, the stored procedures. That way if the repeated lines ever need to change, you can change them in one place and automatically generate the repetition.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/paulfitz/spanish/script.html"" rel=""nofollow"">four</a>. I thought of another one as I was typing; consider it a bonus.</p>

","<p>John's sp_helloworld does work, but here's the reason why you don't see this done more often.</p>

<p>There is a very large performance impact when a stored procedure is compiled.  There's a Microsoft article on troubleshooting performance problems caused by a large number of recompiles, because this really slows your system down quite a bit:</p>

<p><a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243586"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243586</a></p>

<p>Instead of creating the stored procedure, you're better off just creating a string variable with the T-SQL you want to call, and then repeatedly executing that string variable.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - that's a pretty bad performance idea too, but it's better than creating stored procedures on the fly.  If you can persist this code in a permanent stored procedure or function and eliminate the recompile delays, SQL Server can build a single execution plan for the code once and then reuse that plan very quickly.</p>

","<p>Similar to <strong>recursive,</strong> I use an external editor to write my queries. I use Notepad++ with the Light Explorer extension for maintaining several scripts at a time, and Notepad2 for one-off scripts. (I'm kind of partial to Scintilla-based editors.)</p>

<p>Another option is to use the free SQL Server Management Studio Express, which comes with SQL Server Express. <em>(EDIT: Sorry, <strong>EdgarVerona</strong>, I didn't notice you mentioned this already!)</em> I normally use it to write SQL queries instead of using Access, because I typically use ODBC to link to a SQL Server back end anyway. Beware that the differences in the syntax of T-SQL, used by SQL Server, and Jet SQL, used by Access MDB's, are sometimes substantial.</p>

","<p>Debugging is more of a challenge. If a single column is off, that's usually pretty easy to fix. But I'm assuming you have more complex debugging tasks that you need to perform.</p>

<p>When flummoxed, I typically start debugging with the <code>FROM</code> clause. I trace back to all the tables and sub-queries that comprise the larger query, and make sure that the joins are properly defined.</p>

<p>Then I check my <code>WHERE</code> clause. I run lots of simple queries on the tables, and on the sub-queries that I've already checked or that I already trust, and make sure that when I run the larger query, I'm getting what I expect with the <code>WHERE</code> conditions in place. I double-check the <code>JOIN</code> conditions at the same time.</p>

<p>I double-check my column definitions to make sure I'm retrieving what I really want to see, especially if the formulas involved are complicated. If you have something complicated like a coordinated subquery in a column definition</p>

<p>Then I check to see if I'm grouping data properly, making sure that ""<code>DISTINCT</code>""'s and ""<code>UNION</code>""'s without <code>UNION ALL</code> don't remove necessary duplicates.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever encountered a SQL query that couldn't be broken down this way. I'm not always as methodical as this, but it's a good way to start breaking down a real stumper.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>One thing I could recommend when you write your queries is this: <strong>Never use <code>SELECT *</code> in production code.</strong> Selecting all columns this way is a maintenance nightmare, and it leads to big problems when your underlying schemas change. You should always write out each and every column if you're writing SQL code that you'll be maintaining in the future. I saved myself a lot of time and worry just by getting rid of ""<code>SELECT *</code>""'s in my projects.</p>

<p>The downside to this is that those extra columns won't appear automatically in queries that refer to ""<code>SELECT *</code>"" queries. But you should be aware of how your queries are related to each other, anyway, and if you need the extra columns, you can go back and add them.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>There is some hassle involved in maintaining a code repository, but if you have versioning software, the hassle is more than worth it. I've heard of ways of versioning SQL code written in Access databases, but unfortunately, I've never used them.</p>

","<p>Are you talking here about what MS-Access calls 'queries' and SQL call 'views' or about the 'MS-Access pass-through' queries which are SQL queries? Someone could get easily lost! My solution is the following</p>

<ol>
<li>free SQL Server Management
Studio Express, where I will
elaborate and test my queries</li>
<li>a query table on the client
side, with one field for the query
name (<code>id_Query</code>) and another one
(<code>queryText</code>, memo type) for the
query itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>I then have a small function <code>getSQLQuery</code> in my VBA code to be used when I need to execute a query (either returning a recordset or not):</p>

<pre><code>Dim myQuery as string, _
    rsADO as ADODB.recorset

rsADO = new ADODB.recordset
myQuery = getSQLQuery(myId_Query)

'if my query retunrs a recordset'
set rsADO = myADOConnection.Execute myQuery
'or, if no recordset is to be returned'
myADOConnection.Execute myQuery
</code></pre>

<p>For views, it is even possible to keep them on the server side and to refer to them from the client side</p>

<pre><code>set rsADO = myADOConnection.execute ""dbo.myViewName""
</code></pre>

","<p>I guess I don't write complex SQL, because I don't have a problem with the Access SQL editor most of the time. This is because, for the most part, I use the QBE to write the SQL and only dip into the SQL view to do the things the QBE doesn't support (such as non-equi joins, some forms of subqueries, UNION, etc.). This is not to say that I don't have any SQL that is very hard to work with, but that's mostly because it's HIDEOUSLY BADLY WRITTEN, and that's <em>my</em> fault, not Access's fault. I have one horrid, appalling saved QueryDef in an app that's been in production since 1997 that has SQL that's 11,934 characters. And, yes, it's awful to troubleshoot. And nearly any edit I make to it breaks something. But that's because IT'S BAD SQL.</p>

<p>Why anyone would want to write their SQL by hand as a general rule, I can't say. For anything but the most trivial SQL, it seems to me like more trouble than it's worth.</p>

<p>This kind of thing seems to me like another case of people resisting the default Access way of doing things. Almost always, this comes about with users experienced in other programming environments who are too impatient to try things the way Access does them by default. The end result is usually unhappy for everybody.</p>

","<p>In a left join you'd be scanning table1 for each unique combination of (person_uid,period) then searching table2 for all corresponding records there.  If table2 doesn't have an appropriate index, this can involve scanning the whole of that table too.</p>

<p>My best guess, without seeing an execution plan, is that the first query (the only one which seems to be correct) is having to table scan table2 as well as table1.</p>

<p>As you say that you can't change the indexes, you need to change the query.  As far as I can tell, there is only one realistic alternative...</p>

      ON table1.person_uid = table2.person_uid
      AND table1.period = table2.period
WHERE
   table1.person_uid IS NOT NULL
</code></pre>

<p>The hope here is that you scan table2 for each unique combination of (person_uid, period), but make use of indexes on table1.  (As opposed to scanning table1 and making use of indexes on table2, which what I expected from your query.)</p>

<p>If table1 doesn't have appropriate indexes, however, you'll be very unlikely to see any performance improvement at all...</p>

","<p>I think you need to understand why the last two are not the same query as the first one. If you do a left join and then add a where clause referncing a field in the table on the right side of the join (the one which may not always have a record to match the first table), then you have effectively changed the join to an inner join. There is one exception to this and that is if you reference something like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.person_uid = table2.person_uid
WHERE table2.person_uid is null
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you asking for the record which don't have a record in the second table. But other than this special case, you are changing the left join to an inner join if you refence a field in table2 in the where clause.</p>

<p>If your query is not fast enough, I would look at your indexing.</p>

","<p>Here's another ""it depends"" answer... it also depends on how large your table is...</p>

<p>I agree with everyone else who has mentioned checking the execution plan to verify whether or not your index is being used.  </p>

<p>Will the index be used or will a separate index be needed that only includes A, B, C?</p>
","<p>David B is right that you should check the execution plan to verify the index is being used.</p>

<blockquote>Will the index be used or will a separate index be needed that only includes A, B, C?</blockquote>

<p>To answer this last part of the question, which I think is the core underlying topic (as opposed to the immediate solution), there is <em>almost</em> never a reason to index a subset of your indexed columns.  If your index is (A, B, C, D), a WHERE against (A, B, C) will most likely result in an index <strong>seek</strong>, which is the ideal situation -- the index includes all the information the engine needs to go directly to the result set.  I believe this is holds true for numeric types and for equality tests in string types, though it can break down with LIKE '%'s).  On the other hand, if your WHERE only referenced D, you would most likely end up with an index <strong>scan</strong>, which would mean that the SQL engine would have to scan across all combinations of A, B, and C, and then check whether D met your criteria before deciding whether to add the row to the result set.  On a particularly large table, when I found myself having to do a lot of queries against column ""D"", I added an additional index for D only, and saw about 90% performance improvement.</p>

<p>Edit: I should also recommend using the Database Engine Tuning Advisor in SQL Management Studio.  It will tell you if your table isn't indexed ideally for the query you want to run.</p>

","<p>Generally speaking yes it will be, all modern databases are clever enough to do this.  There are exceptions, for example if the statistics on the table show that the volume of data in it is sufficiently small that a full table read will be more efficient then the index will be discounted, but as a rule you can rely on it where appropriate.</p>

<p>Consequently you can take advantage of this when designing your indexes.  Say for example I have a table which contains A, B, C as key values and colums Y and Z containing data which I know will be retrieved often by the statements  </p>

<p>SELECT Y FROM table WHERE A = alpha and B = beta and C = gamma </p>

<p>SELECT Z FROM table WHERE A = alpha and B = beta and C = gamma </p>

<p>The I will generally create an index on A,B,C,X,Z - assuming that X and Z are some reasonably small field.  The reason for this is that I know the access pathway in the statements above will use use the index, and <em>as the data I want to retrieve is already in the index read</em> then no separate read of the block of data required to retrieve the table data itself will be needed.  This strategy can dramatically speed up data retrieval in some circumstances.  Of course you pay for it in update costs and disk space so you need to understand what your database is doing before applying it, but as in most databases reads dramatically outnumber writes it's generally well worth the consideration.</p>

","<p>Start with the simple equals lookup (WHERE A=1 and B='Red' and C=287) yes the index will (most likely) be used. The index will be used first to help the optimizer ""guess"" the number of rows that will match the selection, and then second, to actually access those rows. </p>

<p>In response to David B's comment about the ""like"" predicate, SQLServer may still use the index, it depends on what you're selecting. For example, if you're selecting a count(*) then SQLServer would likely scan the index and count the hits that match the where clause since the index is smaller and would require fewer IOs to scan. And it may decide to do that even if you're selecting some columns from the base table, depending on how selective SQLServer feels the index is.</p>

","<p>Another answer to you question:</p>

<p>If the timestamp column is the only resource for you recovery (no backups etc) you may try to use the following logic </p>

<p><em>Timestamp is simply a value of a counter that is incremented for each insert or update operation that is performed on a table that contains a timestamp column</em>.</p>

<p>If the data import that happened yesterday was one insert of several records you may see a sequence of numbers in the timestamp column like e.g:</p>

<pre><code>0x00000000000007D1
0x00000000000007D2
0x00000000000007D3
0x00000000000007D4
0x00000000000007D5
</code></pre>

<p>The most recent sequence can be your added data (of course it is not guarantied)
You con combine that knowledge with other things (like auto-increment column if you use them) to identify the records you are interested in.</p>

<p>Here are my favourite solution.</p>

<pre><code>@page = 2 -- input parameter
@size = 10 -- can be optional input parameter

if @page &lt; 1 then begin
    @page = 1 -- check page number
end
@start = (@page-1) * @size + 1 -- @page starts at record no @start

-- find the beginning of page @page
SELECT TOP (@start)
    @forename = forename,
    @surname = surname
    @id = id

ORDER BY
    forename,

<p>Does LINQ simplify the solution?</p>
","<p>I'd recommend either using LINQ, or try to copy what it does. I've got an app where I use the LINQ Take and Skip methods to retrieve paged data. The code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyDataContext db = new MyDataContext();
var results = db.Products
    .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)
    .Take(pageSize);
</code></pre>

<p>Running SQL Server Profiler reveals that LINQ is converting this query into SQL similar to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [ProductId], [Name], [Cost], and so on...
FROM (
    SELECT [ProductId], [Name], [Cost], [ROW_NUMBER]
    FROM (
       SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [Name]) AS [ROW_NUMBER],

    WHERE [ROW_NUMBER] BETWEEN 10 AND 20
)
ORDER BY [ROW_NUMBER]
</code></pre>

<p>In plain English:<br />
1. Filter your rows and use the ROW_NUMBER function to add row numbers in the order you want.<br />
2. Filter (1) to return only the row numbers you want on your page.<br />
3. Sort (2) by the row number, which is the same as the order you wanted (in this case, by Name).</p>

172,71920,1,10,sql,How to implement a Digg-like algorithm?,"<p>How to implement a website with a recommendation system similar to stackoverflow/digg/reddit? I.e., users submit content and the website needs to calculate some sort of ""hotness"" according to how popular the item is. The flow is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users submit content</li>
<li>Other users view and vote on the content (assume 90% of the users only views content and 10% actively votes up or down on content)</li>
<li>New content is continuously submitted</li>
</ul>

<p>How do I implement an algorithm that calculates the ""hotness"" of a submitted item, preferably in real-time? Are there any best-practices or design patterns?</p>

<p>I would assume that the algorithm takes the following into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>When an item was submitted</li>
<li>When each vote was cast</li>
<li>When the item was viewed</li>
</ul>

<p>E.g. an item that gets a constant trickle of votes would stay somewhat ""hot"" constantly while an item that receives a burst of votes when it is first submitted will jump to the top of the ""hotness""-list but then fall down as the votes stop coming in.</p>

<p>(I am using a MySQL+PHP but I am interested in general design patterns).</p>
","<p>I developed an social bookmarking site, <a href=""http://www.sites-favoritos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sites Favoritos</a>, and used a complex algoritm:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, the votes are finite, an user only have a limited number of votes, and the number of votes depends on the user points. To earn points each user must add links that get positive votes.</li>
<li>Then, users can vote -3,-2,-1,1,2 or 3 votes for each link. As the votes are limited, each user will vote only on those links that they like.</li>
<li>To prevent user to vote only on links for the same user, creating support groups, the points each vote adds to the link depends on a racio between total votes and votes to links of the owner of the voted link. If you always vote on the same users links, your votes will lose value.</li>
<li>Votes lose value with time.</li>
<li>New links from users who don't have points (new users) will have a starting 0 points. New links from older users will have points depending on their points. Ranging from +3 to -infinite. Links from users with negative points will have negative starting points, links from users with positive points will have positive starting points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users will get random points when their links are voted. Positive votes give positive points, negative votes for negative points.</p>

1153,526460,2,9,sql,AutoIncrement fields on databases without autoincrement field,"<p>In MS Sql Server is easy create autoincrement fields. In my systems I stopped to use autoincrement fields for primary keys, and now I use Guid's. It was awesome, I've got a lot of advantages with that change. But in another non-primary key fields, I really was needing implement a ""soft autoincrement"". It's because my system is DB independent, so I create the autoinc value programatically in c#. </p>

<p>I would like about solutions for autoincrement fields on databases without autoincrement, what the solution that your use and why? There is some Sql Ansi statement about this? and generating directly from my c#, is a better solution?</p>

<p>PS: I know that <em>select max(id)+1 from table</em> it's not really concurrent friendly...</p>
","<p>I think your question is actually quite a good one. However, it is easy to get lost trying to come up with a SQL only solution. In reality you will want the optimization and transaction safety afforded by using the database implementations of the autoincrement types.</p>

<p>If you need to abstract out the implementation of the autoincrement operator, why not create a stored procedure to return your autoincrement value. Most SQL dialects access stored procedures in relatively the same way and it should be more portable. Then you can create database specific autoincrement logic when you create the sproc - eliminating the need to change many statements to be vendor specific.</p>

<p>Done this way, your inserts could be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO foo (id, name, rank, serial_number)
 VALUES (getNextFooId(), 'bar', 'fooRank', 123456);
</code></pre>

<p>Then define getNextFooId() in a database specific way when the database is being initialized.</p>

422,189680,6,9,sql,Database localization,"<p>i am looking for opinions if the following problem maybe has a better/different/common solution:</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I have a database for products which contains the names of the products in english (the default language of this application) and i need translations of the names if available.</p>

<p>Currently i have this setup:</p>

<p>A product table</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE products
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  ""name"" character varying(255) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT products_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)

<p>and a product localization table</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE products_l10n

      REFERENCES products (id) MATCH SIMPLE

<p>and i use the following query to retrieve a list of localized products (german in this case) with fallback to the default english names:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.id, COALESCE(pl.name, p.name)

  language_id int NOT NULL,
  ""name"" character varying(255) NOT NULL,

53,22570,2,9,sql,What's a good way to check if two datetimes are on the same calendar day in TSQL?,"<p>Here is the issue I am having: I have a large query that needs to compare datetimes in the where clause to see if two dates are on the same day.  My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>
","<p>Eric Z Beard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do store all dates in GMT. Here's the use case: something happened at 11:00 PM EST on the 1st, which is the 2nd GMT. I want to see activity for the 1st, and I am in EST so I will want to see the 11PM activity. If I just compared raw GMT datetimes, I would miss things. Each row in the report can represent an activity from a different time zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, but when you say you're interested in activity for Jan 1st 2008 EST:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT @activityDateMidnight = '1/1/2008', @activityDateTZ = 'EST'
</code></pre>

<p>you just need to convert <em>that</em> to GMT (I'm ignoring the complication of querying for the day before EST goes to EDT, or vice versa):</p>

<pre><code>Table: TimeZone
Fields: TimeZone, Offset
Values: EST, -4

--Multiply by -1, since we're converting EST to GMT.
--Offsets are to go from GMT to EST.
SELECT @activityGmtBegin = DATEADD(hh, Offset * -1, @activityDateMidnight)
FROM TimeZone
WHERE TimeZone = @activityDateTZ
</code></pre>

<p>which should give you '1/1/2008 4:00 AM'. Then, you can just search in GMT:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM EventTable
WHERE 
   EventTime &gt;= @activityGmtBegin --1/1/2008 4:00 AM
   AND EventTime &lt; (@activityGmtBegin + 1) --1/2/2008 4:00 AM
</code></pre>

<p>The event in question is stored with a GMT EventTime of 1/2/2008 3:00 AM. You don't even need the TimeZone in the EventTable (for this purpose, at least). </p>

<p>Since EventTime is not in a function, this is a straight index scan - which should be pretty efficient. Make EventTime your clustered index, and it'll fly. ;)</p>

<p>Personally, I'd have the app convert the search time into GMT before running the query.</p>

This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>
","<p>Eric Z Beard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the activity date is meant to indicate the local time zone, but not a specific one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay - back to the drawing board. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>where t.TheDateINeedToCheck BETWEEN (
    dateadd(hh, (tz.Offset + ISNULL(ds.LocalTimeZone, 0)) * -1, @ActivityDate)
    AND
    dateadd(hh, (tz.Offset + ISNULL(ds.LocalTimeZone, 0)) * -1, (@ActivityDate + 1))
)
</code></pre>

<p>which will translate the @ActivityDate to local time, and compare against that. That's your best chance for using an index, though I'm not sure it'll work - you should try it and check the query plan.</p>

<p>The next option would be an indexed view, with an indexed, computed TimeINeedToCheck <em>in local time</em>. Then you just go back to:</p>

<pre><code>where v.TheLocalDateINeedToCheck BETWEEN @ActivityDate AND (@ActivityDate + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>which would definitely use the index - though you have a slight overhead on INSERT and UPDATE then.</p>

1152,526460,14,9,sql,AutoIncrement fields on databases without autoincrement field,"<p>In MS Sql Server is easy create autoincrement fields. In my systems I stopped to use autoincrement fields for primary keys, and now I use Guid's. It was awesome, I've got a lot of advantages with that change. But in another non-primary key fields, I really was needing implement a ""soft autoincrement"". It's because my system is DB independent, so I create the autoinc value programatically in c#. </p>

<p>I would like about solutions for autoincrement fields on databases without autoincrement, what the solution that your use and why? There is some Sql Ansi statement about this? and generating directly from my c#, is a better solution?</p>

<p>PS: I know that <em>select max(id)+1 from table</em> it's not really concurrent friendly...</p>
","<p>The mechanism to generate unique id values <strong>must not</strong> be subject to transaction isolation.  This is required for the database to generate a distinct value for each client, better than the trick of <code>SELECT MAX(id)+1 FROM table</code>, which results in a race condition if two clients try to allocate new <code>id</code> values concurrently.</p>

<p>You can't simulate this operation using standard SQL queries (unless you use table locks or <em>serializable</em> transactions).  It has to be a mechanism built into the database engine.</p>

<p>ANSI SQL did not describe an operation to generate unique values for surrogate keys until SQL:2003.  Before that, there was no standard for auto-incrementing columns, so nearly every brand of RDBMS provided some proprietary solution.  Naturally they vary a lot, and there's no way to use them in a simple, database-independent manner.</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL has the <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column option, or <code>SERIAL</code> pseudo-datatype which is equivalent to <code>BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT</code>;</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server has the <code>IDENTITY</code> column option and <code>NEWSEQUENTIALID()</code> which is something between auto-increment and GUID;</li>
<li>Oracle has a <code>SEQUENCE</code> object;</li>
<li>PostgreSQL has a <code>SEQUENCE</code> object, or <code>SERIAL</code> pseudo-datatype which implicitly creates a sequence object according to a naming convention;</li>
<li>InterBase/Firebird has a <code>GENERATOR</code> object which is pretty much like a <code>SEQUENCE</code> in Oracle;  Firebird 2.1 supports <code>SEQUENCE</code> too;</li>
<li>SQLite treats any integer declared as your primary key as implicitly auto-incrementing;</li>
<li>DB2 UDB has just about everything: <code>SEQUENCE</code> objects, or you can declare columns with the ""<code>GEN_ID</code>"" option.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these mechanisms operate outside transaction isolation, ensuring that concurrent clients get unique values.  Also in all cases there is a way to query the most recently generated value <em>for your current session</em>.  There has to be, so you can use it to insert rows in a child table.</p>

I'm not sure what ds.LocalTimeZone is, though.</p>

<p>If that's the case, then you need to get @activityDateMidnight into GMT instead.</p>

","<p>You're spoilt for choice in terms of options here. If you are using Sybase or SQL Server 2008 you can create variables of type date and assign them your datetime values. The database engine gets rid of the time for you. Here's a quick and dirty test to illustrate (Code is in Sybase dialect):</p>

<pre><code>declare @date1 date
declare @date2 date
set @date1='2008-1-1 10:00'
set @date2='2008-1-1 22:00'
if @date1=@date2
    print 'Equal'
else
    print 'Not equal'
</code></pre>

<p>For SQL 2005 and earlier what you can do is convert the date to a varchar in a format that does not have the time component. For instance the following returns 2008.08.22</p>

<pre><code>select convert(varchar,'2008-08-22 18:11:14.133',102)
</code></pre>

<p>The 102 part specifies the formatting (Books online can list for you all the available formats)</p>

<p>So, what you can do is write a function that takes a datetime and extracts the date element and discards the time. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>create function MakeDate (@InputDate datetime) returns datetime as
begin
    return cast(convert(varchar,@InputDate,102) as datetime);
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use the function for companions</p>

<pre><code>Select * from Orders where dbo.MakeDate(OrderDate) = dbo.MakeDate(DeliveryDate)

","<p>I would normally just insert and trap the DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX exception, as this is the simplest to code.  This is more efficient than checking for existence before inserting.  I don't consider doing this a ""bad smell"" (horrible phrase!) because the exception we handle is raised by Oracle - it's not like raising your own exceptions as a flow-control mechanism.</p>

<p>In this case DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX wins by a mile.  Note the ""select before insert"" is the slowest in both cases.</p>

<p>So it appears that you should choose option 1 or 3 according to the relative likelihood of inserts being or not being duplicates.  </p>

779,350860,1,9,sql,How bad is ignoring Oracle DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX exception?,"<p>I have a table where I'm recording if a user has viewed an object at least once, hence:</p>

<p>Both fields are NOT NULL and together form the Primary Key.</p>

<p>My question is, since I don't care how many times someone has viewed an object (after the first), I have two options for handling inserts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do a SELECT count(*) ... and if no records are found, insert a new record.</li>
<li>Always just insert a record, and if it throws a DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX exceptions (indicating that there already was such a record), just ignore it.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the downside of choosing the second option?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I guess the best way to put it is : ""Is the overhead caused by the exception worse than the overhead caused by the initial select?""</p>

<p>It should return 1, if there is one there, otherwise NULL.</p>

<p>In your case, it looks safe to ignore, but for performance, one should avoid exceptions on the common path.  A question to ask, ""How common will the exceptions be?""
Few enough to ignore? or so many another method should be used?</p>

","<p>While you can put any SQL you like in the conditions of a named scope, if you then call <code>find_by_sql</code> then the 'scopes' get thrown away.</p>

Rails knows that it can add things to the conditions without affecting everything else (which is how <code>with_scope</code> and <code>named_scope</code> work).</p>

<p>With <code>find_by_sql</code> however, you just give rails a big string. It doesn't know what goes where, so it's not safe for it to go in and add the things it would need to add for the scopes to work.</p>

49,22570,3,9,sql,What's a good way to check if two datetimes are on the same calendar day in TSQL?,"<p>Here is the issue I am having: I have a large query that needs to compare datetimes in the where clause to see if two dates are on the same day.  My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>

SQLite:Provides an in memory or file base DB.</p>

<p>In memory DB is useful for holding small DB such as configuration etc.
While for larger data sets a DB server is probably more practical.</p>

  <p>You have a table CLIENT that has a 1:1 relationship with table SALES_OFFICE because, for example, the logic of your system says so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What your app logic says, and what your data model say are 2 different things. There is nothing wrong with enforcing that relationship with your business logic code, but it has no place in the data model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you really incorporate the data of SALES_OFFICE into CLIENT table? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If every CLIENT has a unique SALES_OFFICE, and every SALES_OFFICE has a singular, unique CLIENT - then yes, they should be in the same table. We just need a better name. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if another tables need to relate them selfs with SALES_OFFICE? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no reason to. Relate your other tables to CLIENT, since CLIENT has a unique SALES_OFFICE. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what about database normalization best practices and patterns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <em>is</em> normalization.</p>

<p>To be fair, SALES_OFFICE and CLIENT is obviously not a 1:1 relationship - it's 1:N. Hopefully, your SALES_OFFICE exists to serve more than 1 client, and will continue to exist (for a while, at least) without any clients.</p>

<p>A more realistic example is SALES_OFFICE and ZIP_CODE. A SALES_OFFICE must have exactly 1 ZIP_CODE, and 2 SALES_OFFICEs - even if they have an equivalent ZIP_CODE - do not share the <em>instance</em> of a ZIP_CODE (so, changing the ZIP_CODE of 1 does not impact the other). Wouldn't you agree that ZIP_CODE belongs as a column in SALES_OFFICE?</p>

","<p>It sounds like you are looking for some ORM so that you don't have to bother with hand written SQL code.</p>

<p>There is a post <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/74141/good-orm-for-c-solutions"">here</a> that goes over ORM solutions for C++.</p>

<p>You also did not mention the type of application you are writing, if it is a desktop application, mobile application, server application.</p>

<p>Mobile: You are best off using SQLite as your database engine because it can be embedded and has a small footprint.</p>

<p>Desktop App: You should still consider using SQLite here, but you also have the option with most desktop applications to have an always on connection to the internet in which case you may want to provide a network server for this task.  I suggest using Apache + MySQL + PHP and using a lightweight ORM such as <a href=""http://www.outlet-orm.org/site/"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlet ORM</a>, and then using standard HTTP post calls to access your resources.</p>

<p>Server App: You have many more options here but I still suggest using Apache + MySQL + PHP + ORM because I find it is much easier to maintain this layer in a script language than in C++.</p>

","<p>It was one of my dilemmas when I used to program PHP. Storing images like blobs in the database can make easier to manage security and permissions, but it's costly. 
I always used to store some metadata on the database and the binary contents on the filesystem. Access to images was not direct (<code>&lt;img src=""image/path"" /&gt;</code>) but was provided by PHP scripts that checked the user authentication and authorizations through sessions before showing the image (<code>&lt;img src=""showimage.php?id=$id"" /&gt;</code>). I suggest you to do so (whatever kind of application you're working at).</p>

","<p>Storing binary data (documents, images etc) in the database has some advantages.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can commit the update of the document itself in the same transaction as the information (name, date etc) you want to store about the document.  This means you don't have to worry about writing your own two-phase commit (although ISTR that SQL Server 2008 has a solution for this).</p></li>
<li><p>You can back up the whole lot (documents and metadata) at once, without worrying about having to synchronise the database with the file system</p></li>
<li><p>You can deliver documents very simply over .NET web services, since they come straight out into DataTables, and are serialised effortlessly just by putting the DataTables into a DataSet and passing it.</p></li>
<li><p>You can apply database security to the objects, as to the rest of your data, and not have to worry about network file permissions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It does have some disadvantages too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Backups can get very large</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the binary object in the database can be quite a bit larger than the file it originally came from, and therefore in a client-server environment, it can increase the time taken to open them across the network.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the application, you might need to consider the load on the database server if it has to serve up a lot of large documents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, it's a technique I use extensively, and it works very well.</p>

    			where	PO_QUALIFYING.[PI] in (select [PI] from @test)
    			) AS QUALIFYING
    			on		QUALIFYING.PO = PO_FULL.PO
    			and		QUALIFYING.[PI] = PO_FULL.[PI]

</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if Oracle has CTEs but could just state the inner query as two derived tables. The cross join in the outer query lets us find combinations of offerings that have all the valid items. I know that this will only work based on the statement in the question that the data is such that there is only 1 valid combination for each requested set, Without that it's even more complicated as counts are not enough to remove combinations that have duplicate products in them.</p>

1116,512350,0,7,sql,What coding tricks have you used to avoid writing more sql?,"<p>This question was suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/5486/kyralessa"">Kyralessa</a> in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/488020/what-is-your-most-useful-sql-trick-to-avoid-writing-more-code"">What is your most useful sql trick to avoid writing more sql?.</a>   I got so many good ideas to try from the last question, that I am interested to see what comes up with this question.</p>

<p>Once again, I am not keeping the reputation from this question.  I am waiting 7 days, for answers, then marking it wiki.  The reputation that the question has earned, goes into a bounty for the question.  </p>

<p>Ground Rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>While it is certainly reasonable to write code, to move processing from SQL into the code to address performance issues, that is really not the point of the question.  The question is not limited to performance issues.   The goal is less simply less sql to get the job done.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the concept, so that other users say ""Oh Wow, I didn't know you could do that.""</p></li>
<li><p>Example code is very useful, to help people that are primarily visual learners.</p></li>
<li><p>Explicitly state what Language you are using, and which dialect of SQL you are using.</p></li>
<li><p>Put yourself in your readers shoes.  What would they need to see right there on the screen in front of them, that will cause an epiphany.  Your answer is there to benefit the reader.  Write it for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Offsite links are ok, if they appear after the example.  Offsite links as a substitute for a real answer are not.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably other things to make it nicer for the reader that I haven't thought of.  Get Creative. Share knowledge.  Have fun showing off.</p>

<p>[EDIT] - It looks like there hasen't been any activity in a while.   5 votes = 50, so there is the bounty, and it has been wikified.</p>
","<p>I would highly recommend SQLAlchemy if it's possible for you to use a python environment.</p>

<p>The other thing I tried is writing my own schema generator for testing our systems at work. This was more to generate different combinations of queries to attempt to crash the system.  Basically, I defined a pseudo deparse tree, with dictionaries and lists</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SQLAlchemy</a></p>

<p>Here's a code snippet</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;for row in session.query(User, User.name).all():
...    print row.User, row.name
SELECT users.id AS users_id, users.name AS users_name, users.fullname AS users_fullname, users.password AS users_password FROM users []

207,91360,1,7,sql,How to calculate the sum of values in a tree using SQL,"<p>I need to sum points on each level earned by a tree of users. Level 1 is the sum of users' points of the users 1 level below the user. Level 2 is the Level 1 points of the users 2 levels below the user, etc...</p>

<p>The calculation happens once a month on a non production server, no worries about performance.</p>

<p>What would the SQL look like to do it?</p>

<p>If you're confused, don't worry, I am as well!</p>

<p>User table:</p>

<pre><code>ID    ParentID    Points
1     0           230
2     1           150
3     0           80
4     1           110
5     4           54
6     4           342

Tree:
0
|---\
1    3
| \
2  4---
    \  \
     5  6
</code></pre>

<p>Output should be:</p>

","<p>First I created a table function based on the recursive common table query described by
Dave Markle (thanks for showing me this Dave!). This is extremely sweet because I only have to make the function once and I can use it for analysing any intervals.</p>

<pre><code>if exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects where name = 'fn_daterange') drop function fn_daterange;
go

create function fn_daterange
   (
   @MinDate as datetime,
   @MaxDate as datetime,
   @intval  as datetime
   )
returns table
--**************************************************************************
-- Procedure: fn_daterange()
--    Author: Ron Savage
--      Date: 12/16/2008
--
-- Description:
-- This function takes a starting and ending date and an interval, then
-- returns a table of all the dates in that range at the specified interval.
--
-- Change History:

return
   WITH times (startdate, enddate, intervl) AS
      (
      SELECT @MinDate as startdate, @MinDate + @intval - .0000001 as enddate, @intval as intervl
         UNION ALL
      SELECT startdate + intervl as startdate, enddate + intervl as enddate, intervl as intervl
      FROM times
      WHERE startdate + intervl &lt;= @MaxDate
      )
   select startdate, enddate from times;

go
</code></pre>

<p>So if you do a select from that function all by itself you get a table of time intervals like this:</p>

<p><strong>fn_daterange('12/14/2008 10:00:00', '12/14/2008 20:00:00', '01:00:00' )</strong></p>

<p>returns:</p>

","<p>I recommend creating shared methods that focus on task, and use simple SQL elements, without having to write sql. I use Subsonic for my data access to MS SQL. However, you could make it non- database specific, such as a DAL. These examples could be customized to an ORM or however you access data. I'd recommend to create a static class that narrow's it down to a specific task. </p>

<p>For example, if you have a datagrid to populate and you know a view, table, stored proc to populate it from, create a function similar to the following c# code:</p>

<pre><code>public static void BindDataGridViewWhere(DataGridView dgv, string tablename, string selectList, string whereClause)
{
    Query qQuery = new Query(tablename);
    qQuery.SelectList = selectList;
    qQuery.WHERE(whereClause);
    DataSet dsDGV = qQuery.ExecuteDataSet();
    dgv.DataSource = dsDGV.Tables[0];
    dgv.RowHeadersVisible = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in page init or something like that, simple 1 line call to this method passing the datagridview in with the where statement, what you want to appear and how in the select, and the whereclause and you're bound. </p>

<p>BindDataGridViewWhere(dgvCars, ""tbl_Cars"", ""CarName"", ""Color, mdl as Model"", ""Color = 'blue'"");</p>

<p>This works great for any object that you do a lot of binding with, such as dropdownboxes, listboxes, datagridviews, anything else. Then, for others that don't fit this model, have a method that just returns a dataset. That way if you need to interact with it before displaying it, you can do additional business logic,etc.</p>

<p>I like this approach because if you want to switch data frameworks, you have 1 place to make the change. You can build a screen very quickly this way.</p>

1095,497390,2,7,sql,Mathematical formula for calculating call duration,"<p>I was working for a telecom company some years ago and I had to generate a formula which calculates duration of a call according to the following algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>t1 is the first period  </li>
<li>t2 is the recurring period</li>
<li>RCT is the actual call time (in seconds)</li>
<li>CD is the effective call duration (for billing purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p>if RCT is less than t1, then the CD equals t1<br />
if RCT is greater than t1, then CD = t1 + x*t2, where x will ""round"" RCT to the next highest multiple of t2.</p>

<p>This algorithm translates to: ""Charge for the first t1 seconds, then charge every t2 seconds after that"".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>t1	t2	RCT	CD	
60	10	48	60
60	10	65	70
60	10	121	130
30	20	25	30
30	20	35	50
30	20	65	70
</code></pre>

<p>Can you create a function / SQL that will return the ""call duration"" CD?</p>

<p>Without using if then else ...?</p>
","<p>I would use:</p>

<pre><code>t1 + t2*ceiling( (rct - t1 + abs(rct - t1))*1.00/(2*t2) )
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>t1 + t2*ceiling( Cast((rct - t1 + abs(rct - t1)) as float)/(2*t2) )
</code></pre>

<p>In the past, I've added a numbered order field, and when someone wants to change the order, had to update all the items with their new order numbers.  This is probably the worst approach, since it's not atomic &amp; required several updates.</p>

<p>I notice Django has a multi-valued CommaSeparatedIntegerField which could contain the order by storing the ordered keys to the items in the to-do items table right in one field of the project table.</p>

<p>I've pondered a dewey decimal system where if I wanted to take item 3 and put it between 1 and 2 I would change it's order number to 1.5.</p>

<p>Something tells me there's an easier option that I'm missing though...</p>

<p>How would you give order to a one-to-many relationship?</p>
","<p>""added a numbered order field"" - good.</p>

<p>""update all the items with their new order numbers"" - avoidable.</p>

<p>Use numbers with gaps. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Floating point.  That way, someone can insert ""1.1"" between 1 and 2.  I find that this works nicely, as most people can understand how the sequencing works.  And you don't have to worry too much about how much space to leave -- there's lots and lots of space between each number.</p></li>
<li><p>On the initial load, number the articles by the 100 or 1000 or something with space between each one.  In this case, you have to guess how many digits to leave for reordering.</p></li>
<li><p>A comma-separated position.  Initially, they're all (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), etc. But when you want to rearrange things, you might have to introduce (2,1) and (2,2) that go after (2,0) but before (3.0).</p>

<p>This looks kind of complicated, but some people like this kind of complexity.  It's essentially the same as floating-point, except the single number is replace by a (whole-number, implicit-fraction) tuple.  And this extends to handle hierarchies.</p></li>

If you don't have those platforms, you'll have to actually create a table of times in your database from which you can join off of:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @MinDate DATETIME;
SET @MinDate =  CONVERT(varchar, GETDATE(), 101);

WITH times AS (
    SELECT @MinDate as dt, 1 as depth

    WHERE DATEADD(hh, depth, @MinDate) &lt;= GETDATE())
SELECT DATEPART(YEAR, t.dt) as [Year],

    COUNT(tdm_msg) as Total_ACTIVITES
FROM times t
LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM TCKT_ACT WHERE tdm_msg = '4162' and dev_time &gt;= @MinDate) a
    ON  DATEPART(HOUR, t.dt)  = DATEPART(HOUR, a.dev_time)

","<p>Language: C#/ VB.NET. </p>

<p>I currently can write a DB backed system without writing any SQL at all. My DAL uses the POJO's class definitions to generate SQL on the fly. Example:</p>

<pre><code>SearchCriteria sc = new SearchCriteria();
sc.AddBinding(""Customer_id"", ""ALFKI"");
List&lt;Entity&gt; customers = SQL.Read(sc, new Customers());
</code></pre>

<p>The code above will return a list of Customer instances matching Customer_id to ""ALFKI"". The DAL connects to the db, builds the SQL, executes it, instantiates new objects, populate them and send them back. When you are done changing the objects, simply call</p>

<pre><code>SQL.Write(customer);
</code></pre>

<p>to have all changed items updated back to the db - mind you, only the ones that changed and only the columns that changed.</p>

<p>Added bonus: it supports SQL Server, Oracle, Informix. Client code never has to change.</p>

","<p>Where I work we've done several things to reduce SQL and to reduce the associated overhead of using SQL in Java. (We run Java with MSSQL, MySQL, and Oracle).</p>

<p>The most useful trick is to use Java's setObject method for binding parameters.  This, combined with Varargs, lets you write a utility method for executing SQL:</p>

<pre><code>DBUtil.execSQL(Connection con, String sql, Object... params)
</code></pre>

<p>Simply iterate over the parameters and use statement.setObject(index, param[index-1]).  For nulls you use setNull().  We've extended this concept for queries, with a getResultSet method; the wrapped ResultSet object also closes its statement, making it easier to do resource management.</p>

<p>To reduce actual SQL code written, we have a query building framework that lets you specify a bunch of columns and their types, and then use this to automatically specify search criteria and output columns.  We can easily specify joins and join criteria and this handles most of the normal cases.  The advantage is that you can generate a report in about 10 lines of code, including different query parameters, sorting, grouping, etc.  The code is too complex to include here.</p>

<p>I've also used Oracle's ALL_TABLES and ALL_TAB_COLUMNS tables to generate SELECT statements; another trick I've used is using the ResultSetMetadata to analyze the table:</p>

<pre><code>ResultSet rs = DBUtil.getResultSet(con, ""SELECT * FROM "" + someTable);
ResultSetMetaData rsm = rs.getMetaData();

boolean first = true;
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= rsm.getColumnCount(); i++) {
  String col = rsm.getColumnName(i).toUpperCase();
  // do something with the column name
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it easy to generate certain kinds of statements; in this case we have an active table and an archive table and we are moving records from one to the other.  Without getting into a debate about using an archive table, the Java code I've written lets me modify the two tables without having to modify the archiving script.</p>

<p>Another trick we use is to use constants for all our table and column names.  This makes typing out SQL a little tedious but it allows us to (among other things) generate SQL easily for tables with similar or identical construction.  Since we use constants to define the column names the code actually enforces that the the identical columns have the same name.  Using constants also lets you find references to a particular column, thus allowing you to examine other SQL statements that may be related to the work you are doing.  This lets us re-use SQL from other modules, instead of blindly re-writing the same statement again.</p>

<li>RCT is the actual call time (in seconds)</li>
<li>CD is the effective call duration (for billing purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p>if RCT is less than t1, then the CD equals t1<br />
if RCT is greater than t1, then CD = t1 + x*t2, where x will ""round"" RCT to the next highest multiple of t2.</p>

<p>This algorithm translates to: ""Charge for the first t1 seconds, then charge every t2 seconds after that"".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>t1	t2	RCT	CD	
60	10	48	60
60	10	65	70
60	10	121	130
30	20	25	30
30	20	35	50
30	20	65	70

","<p>The basic answer here involves a left outer join (LOJ), and an explicit <code>COUNT(column)</code> since that does not count nulls but COUNT(*) counts all rows.  The hard part is generating a table against which to do the LOJ.  The WITH clause and recursive solution will work in a number of DBMS (MS SQL Server, apparently, and almost certainly DB2 -- probably others too).</p>

<p>Many DBMS support temporary tables and stored procedures; the combination could be used to populate a table with an appropriate set of values for the date/time field, and then do the LOJ against that table (or, more precisely, FROM temp_table LEFT OUTER JOIN main_table ...).  Not as neat and tidy, but works most places.</p>

","<p>Trees don't work well with SQL. If you have very (very very) few write accesses, you could change the tree implementation to use nested sets, that would make this query incredibly easy (SELECT SUM(points) FROM users where left > x and right &lt; y, if I'm not mistaken). However, any changes on the tree require touching a massive amount of rows. It's probably better to just do the recursion in you client. </p>

","<p>We had a similar problem with some performance monitoring software but, being in a DB2/z mainframe shop, we're dead set against having to do SQL gymnastics to get those sort of results.  SQL queries that perform 'functions' on every row they retrieve are notoriously unscalable and the DBAs would have a field day laughing at us if we tried to use them.</p>

<p>Instead, we found it easier to refactor the database schema to include a count of events in each row (apparently our DBAs don't mind using more disk space, just more CPU grunt).  In your case, that would be adding a column called <code>tdm_quant</code> which you would set to 1 for every row that you insert (i.e., each event).</p>

<p>Then the fifth field of your query changes from <code>count(tdm_msg)</code> to <code>sum(tdm_quant)</code> which will achieve the same result.</p>

<p>In addition to that you can insert a special record (once an hour, or 24 of them at the start of each day, or populate the entire years worth on January 1 if you wish) where the <code>tdm_quant</code> field is set to zero.  Being zero, these records will have no effect on the <code>sum(tdm_quant)</code> but you will get your desired behaviour, a row returned for <strong>every</strong> hour of the day which will have zero as <code>Total_ACTIVITIES</code> where no events occurred in that hour.</p>

<p>The rest of your query will not need to change.</p>

","<p>In one of my projects, I use a meta-model (tables, columns, relations) which adds information to the built-in sys* views.</p>

<p>Part of the data in my meta-model is used to generate logging triggers for insert/update/delete, and to implement cascading deletes in the instead-of delete triggers. With approx. 100 tables the generated code for these triggers is about 12.000 lines of TSQL code.</p>

<p>An SP generates a C# data structure which compares the live database schema with my development database schema to make sure upgrades went ok.</p>

<p>Recently the meta-model even allowed me to generate C# code for delete validation (i.e. can't delete record if depending records exist) in FormView-based Asp.Net forms.</p>

","<p>I rolled my own ORL (Object-Relational Mapper) in PHP for MySQL. It really simplifies everything that has to do with changing the database, and it works very well for simple situations.</p>

<p>It consists of a base class that you can inherit from. You subclass it easily:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class CSomething extends CDatabaseObject
{

}

// create a new Something
$oSomething = new CSomething();
$oSomething-&gt;somevariable = 'blah';
$oSomething-&gt;Save();

// fetch an old Something by primary key
$oSomething = new CSomething(1);
// .. and delete it
$oSomething-&gt;Delete();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It automatically figures out the indexes in the table, and the primary key. If it is required, you can of course tell the class these things if it does something bad.</p>

<p>You can do basic searches by specifying the WHERE clause of the SQL (so it isn't entirely SQL free). Since it nows about the data types of the fields, parameterized queries are simple.</p>

<p>Of course, it can't do everything I need, but it saves a lot of development time and code. </p>

1094,497390,4,7,sql,Mathematical formula for calculating call duration,"<p>I was working for a telecom company some years ago and I had to generate a formula which calculates duration of a call according to the following algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>t1 is the first period  </li>
<li>t2 is the recurring period</li>
<li>RCT is the actual call time (in seconds)</li>
<li>CD is the effective call duration (for billing purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p>if RCT is less than t1, then the CD equals t1<br />
if RCT is greater than t1, then CD = t1 + x*t2, where x will ""round"" RCT to the next highest multiple of t2.</p>

<p>This algorithm translates to: ""Charge for the first t1 seconds, then charge every t2 seconds after that"".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>t1	t2	RCT	CD	
60	10	48	60
60	10	65	70
60	10	121	130
30	20	25	30
30	20	35	50
30	20	65	70
</code></pre>

<p>Can you create a function / SQL that will return the ""call duration"" CD?</p>

<p>Without using if then else ...?</p>
","<p>Assuming int columns:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1
    ,t2
    ,RCT
    CASE
    WHEN RCT &lt; t1
        THEN t1 
    ELSE
        t1 + t2 * ((RCT - t1) / t2 + SIGN((RCT - t1) % t2))
    END AS CD
</code></pre>

<p>But I guess there is still one CASE, let me see if I can get rid of it.</p>

<p>With only integer arithmetic (still not ANSI):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  t1
       ,t2
       ,RCT
       ,CD
       ,t1 + SIGN(RCT / t1) * t2 * ((RCT - t1) / t2 + SIGN((RCT - t1) % t2)) AS CalcCD

204,91360,1,7,sql,How to calculate the sum of values in a tree using SQL,"<p>I need to sum points on each level earned by a tree of users. Level 1 is the sum of users' points of the users 1 level below the user. Level 2 is the Level 1 points of the users 2 levels below the user, etc...</p>

<p>The calculation happens once a month on a non production server, no worries about performance.</p>

<p>What would the SQL look like to do it?</p>

<p>If you're confused, don't worry, I am as well!</p>

<p>User table:</p>

<pre><code>ID    ParentID    Points
1     0           230
2     1           150
3     0           80
4     1           110
5     4           54
6     4           342

Tree:
0
|---\
1    3
| \
2  4---
    \  \
     5  6
</code></pre>

<p>Output should be:</p>

<pre><code>ID    Points    Level1     Level2
1     230       150+110    150+110+54+342

4     110       54+342
5     54
6     342
</code></pre>

<p>SQL Server Syntax and functions preferably...</p>
","<p>If you are working with trees stored in a relational database, I'd suggest looking at ""nested set"" or ""modified preorder tree traversal"". The SQL will be as simple as that:</p>

<p>SELECT id, SUM(value) AS value FROM table WHERE left>left_value_of_your_node AND right

<p>... and do this for every node you are interested in.</p>

","<p>Are you operating in explicit or implicit <a href=""http://doc.ddart.net/mssql/sql70/ta-tz_8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">transaction mode</a>?</p>

<p>Since you're in explicit mode, I think you need to surround the DELETE operation with BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements.</p>

<pre><code>WHILE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID)
BEGIN
    SELECT TOP 1 
            @TmpGFSID = ShoppingCartItem.GFSID, 
            @TmpQuantity = ShoppingCartItem.Quantity,
            @TmpShoppingCartItemID = ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID,
    FROM
            ShoppingCartItem INNER JOIN GoodsForSale on ShoppingCartItem.GFSID = GoodsForSale.GFSID
    WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID

    EXEC @ErrorCode = spGoodsForSale_ReverseReservations @TmpGFSID, @TmpQuantity
    IF @ErrorCode &lt;&gt; 0
    BEGIN
            Goto Cleanup    
    END

    BEGIN TRANSACTION delete

        DELETE FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID = @TmpShoppingCartItemID
        -- @@ROWCOUNT is 1 after this

    COMMIT TRANSACTION delete
END
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> The reason you'd need to use transactions is that the delete doesn't actually happen in the database until you do a COMMIT operation.  This is generally used when you have multiple write operations in an atomic transaction.  Basically, you only want the changes to happen to the DB if all of the operations are successful.</p>

<p>In your case, there's only 1 operation, but since you're in explicit transaction mode, you need to tell SQL Server to <strong>really</strong> make the changes.</p>

337,150250,0,7,sql,While-clause in T-SQL that loops forever,"<p>I was recently tasked with debugging a strange problem within an e-commerce application. After an application upgrade the site started to hang from time to time and I was sent in to debug. After checking the event log I found that the SQL-server wrote ~200 000 events in a couple of minutes with the message saying that a constraint had failed. After much debugging and some tracing I found the culprit. I've removed some unnecessary code and cleaned it up a bit but essentially this is it</p>

<pre><code>WHILE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID)
BEGIN
	SELECT TOP 1 
		@TmpGFSID = ShoppingCartItem.GFSID, 
		@TmpQuantity = ShoppingCartItem.Quantity,
		@TmpShoppingCartItemID = ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID,
	FROM
		ShoppingCartItem INNER JOIN GoodsForSale on ShoppingCartItem.GFSID = GoodsForSale.GFSID
	WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID

	EXEC @ErrorCode = spGoodsForSale_ReverseReservations @TmpGFSID, @TmpQuantity
	IF @ErrorCode &lt;&gt; 0
	BEGIN
		Goto Cleanup	
	END

	DELETE FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID = @TmpShoppingCartItemID
	-- @@ROWCOUNT is 1 after this
END
</code></pre>

<p>Facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's only one or two records matching the first select-clause</li>
<li>RowCount from the DELETE statement indicates that it has been removed</li>
<li>The WHILE-clause will loop forever</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure has been rewritten to select the rows that should be deleted into a temporary in-memory table instead so the immediate problem is solved but this really sparked my curiosity.</p>

<p>Why does it loop forever?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: The delete doesn't fail (@@rowcount is 1 after the delete stmt when debugged)
<strong>Clarification 2</strong>: It shouldn't matter whether or not the SELECT TOP ... clause is ordered by any specific field since the record with the returned id will be deleted so in the next loop it should get another record.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After checking the subversion logs I found the culprit commit that made this stored procedure to go haywire. The only real difference that I can find is that there previously was no join in the SELECT TOP 1 statement i.e. without that join it worked without any transaction statements surrounding the delete. It appears to be the introduction of the join that made SQL server more picky.</p>

<p><strong>Update clarification</strong>:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/150250/while-clause-in-t-sql-that-loops-forever#150400"">brien</a> pointed out that there's no need for the join but we actually do use some fields from the GoodsForSale table but I've removed them to keep the code simply so that we can concentrate on the problem at hand</p>
","<p>Is SQL Server caching the result of the while clause query?  </p>

<p>Is the delete being committed to the database, or does it end up in some transaction that never closes?</p>

681,299770,0,6,sql,Simple Oracle SQL date syntax question,"<p>I am trying to convert a working MS Access query to run on an Oracle database being accessed via VB Script (.asp). This is the last section of the WHERE clause:</p>

<p>The variable ""SD"" (i.e. ""start date"") is a text string that can contain a value such as ""11/11/2008"". The same goes for the variable ""ED"" (i.e. ""end date"").</p>

<p>However, the dates do not work. Does Oracle require a special way to use dates?</p>

<p>Do the dates have to be converted? Do I surround them with the '#' keyword like you would in MS Access?</p>
","<p>Don't forget that the date includes a time (defaults to 00:00:00), so<br />
don't get caught out by something like this:<br />
given three dates, <code>start_date, print_date, end_date</code>, all on the <strong><em>same</em></strong> day<br />
<code>print_date &gt;= start_date AND print_date &lt;= end_date</code> fails because <code>print_date</code> was greater than <code>end_date</code> <strong>:</strong><br />

My partner is the programmer who is doing the development and neither one of us has any real in-depth experience with Google Map API or it's polyline/polygon area capabilities.</p>

<p>We need an easy way to capture inputs within our user admin area where our locations can enter their service coverage area info i.e. 1st street north of Jones blvd, or a 5 mile radius from the location address, etc. and have the Google Map API plot the polyline borders.</p>

<p>Then, visitors to our site need to be able to see this info when they view the google map for one of our locations and also see if their service address falls within that service area or not. We then need to set a flag somehow to trigger a notification to the visitor that their address is not eligible for service or delivery.</p>

<p>If anyone can assist us with this (example php code to interface with the suggested APIs would be preferred and ideal as we simply don't understand the complexities of the Google API, the polyline coordinate capture tool, etc), it would be greatly appreciated, as we have struggled to figure out how to create this in php and more importantly how to integrate it into our existing site.</p>

<p>Update: Thank you for your answer CodeMeIT...how do recommend we capture these longlats in our sql database...i.e. what is the field format or type and do we need to have separate fields for long and lat, and how can we standardize for all locations, i.e. how many long and lats are needed to create a polygon area, as we want to be able to have our location managers input this info for their own locations from their user login areas...</p>

","<p><strong>Draw polygon on map</strong></p>

<p>You can draw polygons that covering your service area on google map.  Those polygons are defined by a set of latlongs that you can collect from a google earth and sasve them somewhere.

","<p>Thanks for all of the feedback and ideas...  </p>

<p>In the simplest of terms, I have a person table that stores contact information like name, email, etc.  I have another table that stores transactions.  Each transaction is really an insurance policy that would contain information on the provider, product type, product name, etc.</p>

<p>I want to avoid giving the user duplicate person records since this causes them to look for the duplicates prior to running mail merges, etc.  I'm getting duplicates when there is more than 1 transaction that has not been terminated, and when there is more than 1 transaction that has been terminated.  </p>

<p>Someone else suggested that I consider a cursor to grab my distinct contact records and then perform the sub selects to get the current and previous insurance information.  I don't know if I want to head down that path though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which avoids the TOP 1 clause and maybe makes it a little clearer.</p>

","<p>It's difficult to understand your question so first I'll throw this out there: does changing your SELECT to SELECT DISTINCT do what you want?</p>

<p>Otherwise, let me get this straight, you're trying to get your customers' current insurance and previous insurance, but they may actually have many insurances before that, recorded in the [transactions] table?

<p>Expectation:</p>

","<p>Given that you can't expect deterministic performance on a system that could (at least in theory) be subject to transient load spikes, you want your performance SLA to be probabilistic.  An example of this might be:</p>

<p>95% of transactions to complete within 2 seconds.<br>
95% of search queries (more appropriate for a search screen) to complete within 10 seconds.<br>
95% of operational reports to complete within 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Transactional and search queries can't be moved off transactional system, so the only actions you can take are database or application tuning, or buying faster hardware.  </p>

<p>For operational reports, you need to be ruthless about what qualifies as an operational report.  Only reports that <em>absolutely</em> need to have access to up-to-date data should be run off the live system.  Reports that do a lot of I/O are very anti-social on a production system, and normalised schemas tend to be quite inefficient for reporting.  Move any reports that do not require real-time data off onto a data warehouse or some other separate reporting facility.</p>

","<p>I assume yours is a VARCHAR(MAX) column which, as the error says, is an invalida data type for an index. Suggestion: create a calculated column that is the hash value of the VARCHAR(MAX) column (e.g. using the HashBytes function) then create an index on the calculated column only. Then, in the search condition (e.g. WHERE clause) of your SQL DML you would use both the VARCHAR(MAX) search value itself <em>plus</em> a hash of your VARCHAR(MAX) search value on the respective columns in your table. It may be a good idea to encapsulate the hashing of search values in a 'helper' stored procedure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look into using a high quality email service provider that specializes in managing bounces, unsubscribes, isp and black list management, etc. If sending email is critical to your business, but not your main business it will be worth it. Most will have an api for sending templated messages, click tracking, open rates and will have provide triggers etc. </li>
<li>Look into the SQL Server Service Broker to queue the actual messages, otherwise you can consider Microsoft Message Queuing Services. There is no need to build your own queuing service. We spent too much time dealing with queing infrastructure code when this was already solved.</li>
<li>Develop a flexible set of events on your business tier to allow for the triggering of such messages and put them in your queue asynchronously, this will save you alot of grief in the long run as opposed to polling on the DB or hacking it in with Database triggers.</li>

","<p>LINQ-to-SQL supports use with UDFs, if that is what you mean. Just drag the UDF onto the designer surface and you're done. This creates a matching method on the data-context, marked <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.linq.mapping.functionattribute.aspx""><code>[Function(..., IsComposable=true)]</code></a> or similar, telling LINQ-to-SQL that it can use this in queries (note that EF doesn't support this usage).</p>

<p>You would then use it in your query like:</p>

<pre><code>var qry = from cust in ctx.Custs
           select new {Id = cust.Id, Value = ctx.GetTotalValue(cust.Id)};
</code></pre>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.Id, dbo.MyUdf(t1.Id)
FROM CUSTOMER t1
</code></pre>

<p>(or there-abouts).</p>

<p>The fact that it is composable means that you can use the value in queries - for example in a <code>Where()</code>/<code>WHERE</code> - and so reduce the data brought back from the server (although obviously the UDF will still need to be executed in some way).</p>

<p><a href=""http://groups.google.co.uk/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.languages.csharp/browse_thread/thread/608b6b08532ed7eb/4cf42640934bf45e#bfc790be1a24e37a"">Here's a similar example</a>, showing a pseudo-UDF at use on a data-context, illustrating that the C# version of the method is not used.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm currently looking at such UDFs to provide ""out of model"" data in a composable way - i.e. a particular part of the system needs access to some data (that happens to be in the same database) that isn't really part of the same model, but which I want to <code>JOIN</code> in interesting ways. I also have existing SPs for this purpose... so I'm looking at porting those SPs to tabular UDFs, which provides a level of contract/abstraction surrounding the out-of-model data. So because it isn't part of my model, I can only get it via the UDF - yet I retain the ability to compose this with my regular model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put, when you are using this isolation level, and you are performing multiple queries on an active table as part of one transaction, there is no guarantee that the information returned to you within different parts of the transaction will remain the same. You could query the same data twice within one transaction and get different results (this might happen in the case where a different user was updating the same data in the midst of your transaction). This can obviously have severe ramifications for parts of your application that rely on data integrity.</p>

1079,495390,4,5,sql,ORM or something to handle SQL tables with an order column efficiently,"<p>I got an Java application using SQL tables that contains an ordered list of entities, ordered by
an order column. I would like to add/remove things in/from the middle

could provide this kind of functionality with batch update of order
column. </p>

<p>At the basic case Hibernate (and probably others also) provide this
functionality. 
The problem is that the objects are handled one at time, which becomes
problem when the list is large enough. Alternate solution would be to
do the thing with a batch SQL update, like the following for example:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table SET order_col = order_col + 1 WHERE order_col &gt; 47
INSERT TO table VALUES ('new_id', 'new_description, ..., 47)
</code></pre>

<p>which is done quite fast by the database engine but isn't supported. </p>

kind of batch updates don't fit so well when thinking the objects and their
versioning, dirty checking etc.

framework / ORM / you-name-it would provide some help.

","<p>My advice is to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose very large increments between your items, say one million.  This way you can move an item at 8,000,000 to before 7,000,000 by changing just it to 6,500,000; and</li>
<li>Every now and again reorder the items as a batch job.</li>
</ol>

<p>The large increments don't eliminate the problem of doing a large reorder but the need to do a big reorder highly unlikely and the batch job is there to reorder them say once every day/week/month as required.</p>

<p>Changing a whole bunch of items at once is just messy and asking for trouble.</p>

","<p>If you really want to end up with a continuous sequential order, you can do it like this:</p>

<p>First of all, multiply the <code>sortorder</code> by say 1000</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE testtable SET sortorder = sortorder * 1000
</code></pre>

<p>Now do your inserts and insert suitable <code>sortorder</code> values to have the new entries in the right place.</p>

<p>Now do a table update and update the values using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)#ROW_NUMBER.28.29_window_function"" rel=""nofollow"">ROW_NUMBER</a> function</p>

    ID as innerID,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY sortorder ASC) as newsortorder
  FROM testtable
  ) subq
WHERE subq.innerID = ID
</code></pre>

<p>The ID is selected as <code>innerID</code> as the updated table can't be aliased and the ID column would otherwise end up ambiguous.</p>

705,319280,16,5,sql,Postgresql Concurrency,"<p>In a project that I'm working, there's a table with a ""on update"" trigger, that monitors if a boolean column has changed (ex.: false -> true = do some action). But this action can only be done once for a row.</p>

<p>There will be multiple clients accessing the database, so I can suppose that eventually, multiple clients will try to update the same row column in parallel.</p>

<p>Does the ""update"" trigger itself handle the concurrency itself, or I need to do it in a transaction and manually lock the table?</p>
","<p>Triggers don't handle concurrency, and PostgreSQL should do the right thing whether or not you use explicit transactions.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL uses <em>optimistic locking</em> which means the first person to actually update the row gets a lock on that row.  If a second person tries to update the row, their update statement waits to see if the first commits their change or rolls back.  </p>

<p>If the first person commits, the second person gets an error, rather than their change going through and obliterating a change that might have been interesting to them.</p>

<p>If the first person rolls back, the second person's update un-blocks, and goes through normally, because now it's not going to overwrite anything.</p>

<p>The second person can also use the <code>NOWAIT</code> option, which makes the error happen immediately instead of blocking, if their update conflicts with an unresolved change.</p>

366,155540,0,5,sql,How can I tell when .Net System.Diagnostics.Process ran sucessfully or failed?,"<p>I'm writing a scheduler or sorts.  It's basically a table with a list of exes (like ""C:\a.exe"") and a console app that looks at the records in the table every minute or so and runs the tasks that haven't been run yet.</p>

<p>I run the tasks like this:</p>

<pre><code>System.Diagnostics.Process p = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
p.StartInfo.FileName = someExe; // like ""a.exe""
p.Start();

<p>How can I tell if a particular task failed?  For example what if a.exe throws an unhandled exception?  I'd like the above code to know when this happens and update the tasks table with something like ""the particular task failed"" etc.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>p.s.  I'm not using the Sql Agent or the Windows Scheduler because someone else told me not to.  He has more ""experience"" so I'm basically just following orders.  Feel free to suggest alternatives.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>To expand on what @jop said. You will also need to wait for the process to close. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>        p.Start();
        p.WaitForExit();

<p>with these function-based indices:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX idx_person_upper_given_names ON person (UPPER(given_names));

</code></pre>

<p>Now, given_names has no NULL values but for argument's sake last_name does.  If I do this:</p>

<p>it doesn't.  The Oracle docs say that to use the function-based index will only be used when several conditions are met, one of which is ensuring there are no NULL values since they aren't indexed.</p>

","<p>In your example you've created the same index twice - this would give an error so I'm assuming that was a mistake in pasting, not the actual code you tried.</p>

<p>I tried it with</p>

","<p>Are you sure you want the index to be used?  Full table scans are not bad.  Depending on the size of the table, it might be more efficient to do a table scan than use an index.  It also depends on the density and distribution of the data, which is why statistics are gathered.  The cost based optimizer can usually be trusted to make the right choice.  Unless you have a specific performance problem, I wouldn't worry too much about it.</p>

","<p>One piece of information missing is the number of indices on the table you are deleting the data from. As SQL Server uses the Primary Key as a pointer in every index, any change to the primary index requires updating every index. Though, unless we are talking a high number, this shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>I am guessing, from your description, that this is a primary table in the database, referenced by many other tables in FK relationships.  This would account for the large number of locks as it checks the rest of the tables for references. And, if you have cascading deletes turned on, this could lead to a delete in table a requiring checks several tables deep.</p>

921,430000,8,5,sql,SQL Exclude LIKE items from table,"<p>I'm trying to figure out how to exclude items from a select statement from table A using an exclusion list from table B. The catch is that I'm excluding based on the prefix of a field.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT FieldName

","<p>I wouldn't personally follow rigid rules.  Certainly during the development stages, you want to be able to quickly change your queries so I would inline them.</p>

<p>Later on, I would move to stored procedures because they offer the following two advantages.  I'm sure there are more but these two win me over.</p>

<p>1/ Stored procedures group the data and the code for manipulating/extracting that data at one point.  This makes the life of your DBA a lot easier (assuming your app is sizable enough to warrant a DBA) since they can optimize based on known factors.</p>

<p>One of the big bugbears of a DBA is ad-hoc queries (especially by clowns who don't know what a full table scan is).  DBAs prefer to have nice consistent queries that they can tune the database to.</p>

<p>2/ Stored procedures can contain logic which is best left in the database.  I've seen stored procs in DB2/z with many dozens of lines but all the client has to code is a single line like ""give me that list"".</p>

<p>Because the logic for ""that list"" is stored in the database, the DBAs can modify how it's stored and extracted at will <strong>without</strong> compromising or changing the client code.  This is similar to encapsulation that made object-orientd languages 'cleaner' than what came before.</p>

644,279610,1,4,sql,Create DB2 History Table Trigger,"<p>I want to create a history table to track field changes across a number of tables in DB2. </p>

<p>I know history is usually done with copying an entire table's structure and giving it a suffixed name (e.g. user --> user_history). Then you can use a pretty simple trigger to copy the old record into the history table on an UPDATE.</p>

<p>However, for my application this would use too much space. It doesn't seem like a good idea (to me at least) to copy an entire record to another table every time a field changes. So I thought I could have a generic 'history' table which would track individual field changes:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE history
(
    history_id LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    table_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    field_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    field_value VARCHAR(1024),
    change_time TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (history_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so every table that I want to track has a single, auto-generated id field as the primary key, which would be put into the 'record_id' field. And the maximum VARCHAR size in the tables is 1024. Obviously if a non-VARCHAR field changes, it would have to be converted into a VARCHAR before inserting the record into the history table.</p>

<p>Now, this could be a completely retarded way to do things (hey, let me know why if it is), but I think it it's a good way of tracking changes that need to be pulled up rarely and need to be stored for a significant amount of time.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I need help with writing the trigger to add records to the history table on an update. Let's for example take a hypothetical user table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE user
(
   user_id INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   username VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
   first_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   last_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   email_address VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
   PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>So, can anyone help me with a trigger on an update of the user table to insert the changes into the history table? My guess is that some procedural SQL will need to be used to loop through the fields in the old record, compare them with the fields in the new record and if they don't match, then add a new entry into the history table. </p>

<p>It'd be preferable to use the same trigger action SQL for every table, regardless of its fields, if it's possible.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I don't think this is a good idea, as you generate even more overhead per value  with a big table where more than one value changes. But that depends on your application.</p>

<p>Furthermore you should consider the practical value of such a history table. You have to get a lot of rows together to even get a glimpse of context to the value changed and it requeries you to code another application that does just this complex history logic for an enduser. And for an DB-admin it would be cumbersome to restore values out of the history.</p>

<p>it may sound a bit harsh, but that is not the intend. An experienced programmer in our shop had a simmilar idea through table journaling. He got it up and running, but it ate diskspace like there's no tomorrow. </p>

<p>Just think about what your history table should really accomplish.</p>

<p>Google was not very helpful to me on this. Please provide a coding example.</p>
","<p>No coding example is really going to work.  You have to make a determination from the table as to what is the unique identifier for the table.  If there is no primary key (or at the least, a unique index), then you are out of luck.</p>

<p>The only way around this is to create a dynamic command yourself, which compares every value in the table to the record you want to delete.  If they are the same, then delete them.</p>

<p>However, you run the risk of deleting multiple rows from the table, since there might be multiple rows in the table with the same values.</p>

645,279610,1,4,sql,Create DB2 History Table Trigger,"<p>I want to create a history table to track field changes across a number of tables in DB2. </p>

<p>I know history is usually done with copying an entire table's structure and giving it a suffixed name (e.g. user --> user_history). Then you can use a pretty simple trigger to copy the old record into the history table on an UPDATE.</p>

<p>However, for my application this would use too much space. It doesn't seem like a good idea (to me at least) to copy an entire record to another table every time a field changes. So I thought I could have a generic 'history' table which would track individual field changes:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE history
(
    history_id LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    table_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    field_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    field_value VARCHAR(1024),
    change_time TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (history_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so every table that I want to track has a single, auto-generated id field as the primary key, which would be put into the 'record_id' field. And the maximum VARCHAR size in the tables is 1024. Obviously if a non-VARCHAR field changes, it would have to be converted into a VARCHAR before inserting the record into the history table.</p>

<p>Now, this could be a completely retarded way to do things (hey, let me know why if it is), but I think it it's a good way of tracking changes that need to be pulled up rarely and need to be stored for a significant amount of time.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I need help with writing the trigger to add records to the history table on an update. Let's for example take a hypothetical user table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE user
(
   user_id INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   username VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
   first_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   last_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   email_address VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
   PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>So, can anyone help me with a trigger on an update of the user table to insert the changes into the history table? My guess is that some procedural SQL will need to be used to loop through the fields in the old record, compare them with the fields in the new record and if they don't match, then add a new entry into the history table. </p>

<p>It'd be preferable to use the same trigger action SQL for every table, regardless of its fields, if it's possible.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Have you considered doing this as a two step process?  Implement a simple trigger that records the original and changed version of the entire row.  Then write a separate program that runs once a day to extract the changed fields as you describe above.</p>

<p>This makes the trigger simpler, safer, faster and you have more choices for how to implement the post processing step.</p>

","<p>We do something similar on our SQL Server database, but the audit tables are for each indvidual table audited (one central table would be huge as our database is many many gigabytes in size)</p>

<p>One thing you need to do is make sure you also record who made the change. You should also record the old and new value together (makes it easier to put data back if you need to) and the change type (insert, update, delete). You don't mention recording deletes from the table, but we find those the some of the  things we most frequently use the table for.</p>

<p>We use dynamic SQl to generate the code to create the audit tables (by using the table that stores the system information) and all audit tables have the exact same structure (makes is easier to get data back out).</p>

647,279610,1,4,sql,Create DB2 History Table Trigger,"<p>I want to create a history table to track field changes across a number of tables in DB2. </p>

<p>I know history is usually done with copying an entire table's structure and giving it a suffixed name (e.g. user --> user_history). Then you can use a pretty simple trigger to copy the old record into the history table on an UPDATE.</p>

<p>However, for my application this would use too much space. It doesn't seem like a good idea (to me at least) to copy an entire record to another table every time a field changes. So I thought I could have a generic 'history' table which would track individual field changes:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE history
(
    history_id LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    table_name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    field_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    field_value VARCHAR(1024),
    change_time TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (history_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so every table that I want to track has a single, auto-generated id field as the primary key, which would be put into the 'record_id' field. And the maximum VARCHAR size in the tables is 1024. Obviously if a non-VARCHAR field changes, it would have to be converted into a VARCHAR before inserting the record into the history table.</p>

<p>Now, this could be a completely retarded way to do things (hey, let me know why if it is), but I think it it's a good way of tracking changes that need to be pulled up rarely and need to be stored for a significant amount of time.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I need help with writing the trigger to add records to the history table on an update. Let's for example take a hypothetical user table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE user
(
   user_id INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   username VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
   first_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   last_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
   email_address VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
   PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
);
</code></pre>

<p>So, can anyone help me with a trigger on an update of the user table to insert the changes into the history table? My guess is that some procedural SQL will need to be used to loop through the fields in the old record, compare them with the fields in the new record and if they don't match, then add a new entry into the history table. </p>

<p>It'd be preferable to use the same trigger action SQL for every table, regardless of its fields, if it's possible.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

142,54980,2,4,sql,How do prepared statements work?,"<p>I'm writing some DB routines and I'm using prepared statements.  My environment is PDO with PHP5.</p>

<p>I understand prepared statements primarily provide a performance benefit, as well as some auxiliary bonuses such as not having to manually SQL-escape input data.</p>

<p>My question is about the performance part.</p>

<p>I have two implementations of a getPrice function below that takes a product id and returns its price.</p>

<p>getPrice_A reuses the same PDOStatement object across subsequent calls within the same script execution.  Is this necessary or recommended?  If so, is there any way to avoid duplicating this extra code across every single get*() in every single model?</p>

<p>getPrice_B creates a new PDOStatement object on every call.  Will the DBMS recognize this statement has already been prepared and still be able to skip some work?  In other words, does this implementation properly take advantage of the performance benefits of prepared statements?</p>

<p>Having written all this out and read it over, I imagine getPrice_B is fine and getPrice_A is providing a negligible benefit on top of that, which may or may not be worth the extra complication.</p>

<p>I'd still like to hear for sure from someone more knowledgable though.</p>

<p>Assume that <code>$pdo</code> is a valid, connected PDO object in the examples below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Product {
    static function &amp;getPrice_A($id) {
        static $stmt;
        if (!$stmt) {
            $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = ?');
        }
        $stmt-&gt;execute(array($id));
        return $stmt-&gt;fetchColumn(0);
    }

    static function &amp;getPrice_B($id) {
        $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = ?');
        $stmt-&gt;execute(array($id));
        return $stmt-&gt;fetchColumn(0);
    }
}

// example usage:
$price = Product::getPrice(4982);
echo ""Product 4982 costs $price\n"";
</code></pre>
","<p>From what I understand, prepared statements will reuse the generated SQL plan if it is the same statement, so the database will see the same prepared statement and not have to do the work to figure out how to query the database. I would say the extra work of saving the prepared statement in <code>Product::getPrice_A</code> is not typically very helpful, more because it can obscure the code rather than an issue of performance.  When dealing with performance, I feel it's always best to focus on code clarity and then performance when you have real statistics that indicate a problem.</p>

<p>I would say ""yes, the extra work is unnecessary"" (regardless of if it really boosts performance).  Also, I am not a very big DB expert, but the performance gain of prepared statements is something I heard from others, and it is at the database level, not the code level (so if the code is actually invoking a parameterized statement on the actual DB, then the DB can do these execution plan caching... though depending on the database, you may get the benefit even without the parameterized statement).</p>

<p>Anyways, if you are really worried about (and seeing) database performance issues, you should look into a caching solution... of which I would highly recommend <a href=""http://www.danga.com/memcached/"" rel=""nofollow"">memcached</a>.  With such a solution, you can cache your query results and not even hit the database for things you access frequently.</p>

","<p>I've done a mix of inline queries and stored procedures. I prefer more of the stored procedure/view approach as it gains a nice spot for you to make a change if needed. When you have inline queries you always have to go and change the code to change an inline query and then re-roll the application. You also might have the inline query in multiple places so you would have to change a lot more code than with one stored procedure.</p>

<p>Then again if you have to add a parameter to a stored procedure, your still changing a lot of code anyways. </p>

<p>Another note is how often the data changes behind the stored procedure, where I work we have third party tables that may break up into normalized tables, or a table becomes obsolete. In that case a stored procedure/view may minimize the exposure you have to that change.</p>

<p>I've also written a entire application without stored procedures. It had three classes and 10 pages, was not worth it at all. I think there comes a point when its overkill, or can be justified, but it also comes down to your personal opinion and preference. </p>

<p>EDIT- Just to clarify, the stored procedure DOES return results which I have confirmed because the loop runs through fine if I remove the HasRows check. Changing just the name of the SQL server in the connection string to an identical database running on SQL 2000 makes the problem go away. I've checked that NOCOUNT is off, so what else could make HasRows return false when that's not the case??</p>

788,351340,2,4,sql,What's the shortest TSQL to concatenate a person's name which may contain nulls,"<p>3 fields: FirstName, MiddleName, LastName</p>

<p>Any field can be null, but I don't want extra spaces. Format should be ""First Middle Last"", ""First Last"", ""Last"", etc.</p>
","<p>Why not use a computed column on the table that performs the concat for you using your preferred syntax from the many posted here? Then you will just query the computed column - very elegant and if you persist the computed column then you may even get slight performance increase.

456,197220,0,4,sql,SqlDataReader.HasRows returns false since SQL 2008 upgrade,"<p>I've got an ASP.NET 2.0 website that connects to a SQL database. I've upgraded the SQL server from 2000 to 2008 and since then, one page refuses to work. </p>

<p>I've worked out the problem is that the call to SqlDataReader.HasRows is returning false even though the dataset is not empty and removing the check allows the loop through reader.Read() to access the expected data. </p>

<pre><code>    _connectionString = WebConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""SQLServer""].ConnectionString;
    SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(searchtype, connection);
    SqlParameter _parSeachTerm = new SqlParameter(""@searchterm"", SqlDbType.VarChar, 255);
    _parSeachTerm.Value = searchterm;
    command.Parameters.Add(_parSeachTerm);
    command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    try
    {
        connection.Open();
        SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        if (reader.HasRows) //this always returns false!?
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {...
</code></pre>

<p>Does anybody have any idea what's going on? There are similar code blocks on other pages where HasRows returns the correct value.</p>

<p>EDIT- Just to clarify, the stored procedure DOES return results which I have confirmed because the loop runs through fine if I remove the HasRows check. Changing just the name of the SQL server in the connection string to an identical database running on SQL 2000 makes the problem go away. I've checked that NOCOUNT is off, so what else could make HasRows return false when that's not the case??</p>

<p>EDIT2- Here's the SP</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE StaffEnquirySurnameSearch

<p>Is the cost of serialization your Data Transport Object less then a DataSet?</p>
","<p>At some point, it depends on the purpose of the library, or I sould say, the functionality of the library. Since the OOP hype, the ""general consensus"" is to first retrieve/fetch the data in the DAL using datareaders as they are faster, then load up your objects and close your readers, however, this is not always the case. To keep simplicity, some pass back the dataset so that gridviews can be bounded and paging/sorting can be enabled with minimal code. Remember simple is best.</p>

<p>In reporting application however, I've noticed a likeness for datasets, especially if the data is exposed by webservices. </p>

<p>The cost of serilization will be based on the usage of the application and also experience. An inexperience developer may return 3000 to 50000 rows of un-necessary data in a dataset. Remember the dataset is an animal, but with a lot of functionality. Use wisely.</p>

<p>Most ORM does serialization behind the scenes (I stand corrected here)so it could be fair to say that it wouldn't cost that much, but then again it depends on the application.</p>

","<p>I'd have to agree with Justice, not necessarily about NHibernate (altho it's a great option) I would definately look at using some sort of ORM like NHibernate, Subsonic, Linq-to-sql, llblgen or any other one of the ORMs around.</p>

<p>As <a href=""http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/11/07/how-to-design-your-data-connectivity-strategy.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Jeremy Miller states:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you're writing ADO.Net code by
  hand, you're stealing from your
  employer or client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and to that end, I'd have to recommend returning objects as opposed to datasets or datatables.</p>

459,200810,1,4,sql,How can I do access control via an SQL table?,"<p>I'm trying to create an access control system. </p>

<p>Here's a stripped down example of what the table I'm trying to control access to looks like:</p>

<pre><code>things table:
id   group_id   name
1    1          thing 1
2    1          thing 2
3    1          thing 3
4    1          thing 4
5    2          thing 5
</code></pre>

<p>And the access control table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>access table:
user_id  type   object_id  access
1        group  1          50
1        thing  1          10
1        thing  2          100
</code></pre>

<p>Access can be granted either by specifying the id of the 'thing' directly, or granted for an entire group of things by specifying a group id. In the above example, user 1 has been granted an access level of 50 to group 1, which should apply unless there are any other rules granting more specific access to an individual thing.</p>

<p>I need a query that returns a list of things (ids only is okay) along with the access level for a specific user. So using the example above I'd want something like this for user id 1:</p>

<pre><code>desired result:
thing_id   access
1          10
2          100
3          50   (things 3 and 4 have no specific access rule,
4          50   so this '50' is from the group rule)
5               (thing 5 has no rules at all, so although I 
                still want it in the output, there's no access
		level for it)
</code></pre>

<p>The closest I can come up with is this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM things 
LEFT JOIN access ON 
	user_id = 1
	AND (
		(access.type = 'group' AND access.object_id = things.group_id)
		OR (access.type = 'thing' AND access.object_id = things.id)
	)
</code></pre>

<p>But that returns multiple rows, when I only want one for each row in the 'things' table. I'm not sure how to get down to a single row for each 'thing', or how to prioritise 'thing' rules over 'group' rules.</p>

<p>If it helps, the database I'm using is PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Please feel free to leave a comment if there's any information I've missed out. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>While there are several good answers, the most efficient would probably be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT things.id, things.group_id, things.name, max(access) 
FROM things 
LEFT JOIN access ON 
        user_id = 1 
        AND (
                (access.type = 'group' AND access.object_id = things.group_id)
                OR (access.type = 'thing' AND access.object_id = things.id)
        )
group by things.id, things.group_id, things.name
</code></pre>

<p>Which simply uses summarization added to you query to get what you're looking for.</p>

","<p>Tony:</p>

<p>Not a bad solution, I like it, seems to work. Here's your query after minor tweaking:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    things.*, 
    coalesce ( 
        (   SELECT access 
            FROM access 
            WHERE user_id = 1 
                AND type = 'thing' 
                AND object_id = things.id
        ), 
        (   SELECT access 
            FROM access 
            WHERE user_id = 1 
                AND type = 'group' 
                AND object_id = things.group_id 
        ) 
    ) AS access
    FROM things;
</code></pre>

<p>And the results look correct:</p>

<pre><code> id | group_id |  name   | access 
----+----------+---------+--------
  1 |        1 | thing 1 |     10

  4 |        1 | thing 4 |     50
  5 |        2 | thing 5 |
</code></pre>

<p>I do <em>completely</em> take the point about it not being an ideal schema. However, I am stuck with it to some extent.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Josef:</p>

<p>Your solution is very similar to the stuff I was playing with, and my instincts (such as they are) tell me that it should be possible to do it that way. Unfortunately it doesn't produce completely correct results:</p>

<pre><code> id | group_id |  name   | max 
----+----------+---------+-----
  1 |        1 | thing 1 |  50
  2 |        1 | thing 2 | 100

  4 |        1 | thing 4 |  50
  5 |        2 | thing 5 |
</code></pre>

<p>The access level for 'thing 1' has taken the higher 'group' access value, rather than the more specific 'thing' access value of 10, which is what I'm after. I don't think there's a way to fix that within a <code>GROUP BY</code>, but if anyone has any suggestions I'm more than happy to be proven incorrect on that point.</p>

106,38680,0,3,sql,How to provide next page of updated content?,"<p>Feel free to edit the title if you know how to formulate the question better. (Tagging is a problem as well.) The problem may be too difficult in this general form, so let us consider a concrete example.</p>

<p>You get a screenful of stackoverflow questions by requesting <code>/questions ?sort=newest</code> page. Next page link leads to <code>/questions?page=2 &amp;sort=newest</code>. I suppose that at server side, the request is translated into an SQL query with LIMIT clause. Problem with this approach is, that if new question were added while user browses first page, his second page will start with some questions he already saw. (If he has 10 question per page, and 10 new questions happened to be added, heâll get exactly the same content second time!)</p>

<p>Is there an elegant way to solve this common problem? I realize that it is not that big a problem, at least not for stackoverflow, but still.</p>

<p>The best idea I have (apart from storing request history per client) is to use <code>/questions?answer_id=NNN</code> format. Server returns a page that starts with the requested answer, and puts the id of the first answer on the next page into next page link. There must be a way to write SQL for that, right? </p>

<p>Is it how it usually done? Or there is a better way?</p>
","<p>Tag each question with its time entered into the database, carry the time the frontpage was last loaded as a cookie or part of the URL, and limit the search to items <code>n</code> through <code>n+displaynum</code> as you go forward.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't bother. This behavior is uniform enough that most users expect it, and it serves as a flag for when new data is becoming available. You can even open a new tab/window that starts back at the top of the list to see what has come up.</p>

<p>Update - false sorts before true - I had it backwards originally. Note that DISTINCT ON is a PostgreSQL feature and not part of standard SQL. What happens here is that it only shows you the first row for any given id that it comes across.

","<p>The crux of the problem is to compute one or more measures of distance between each pair of entries and then consider them to be the same when one of the distances is less than a certain acceptable threshold.  The key is to setup the analysis and then vary the acceptable distance until you reach what you consider to be the best trade-off between false-positives and false-negatives.</p>

<p>One distance measurement could be phonetic.  Another you might consider is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">Levenshtein or edit distance</a> between the entires, which would attempt to measure typos.</p>

<p>If you have a reasonable idea of how many persons you should have, then your goal is to find the sweet spot where you are getting about the right number of persons.  Make your matching too fuzzy and you'll have too few.  Make it to restrictive and you'll have too many.</p>

<p>If you know roughly how many entries a person should have, then you can use that as the metric to see when you are getting close.  Or you can divide the number of records into the average number of records for each person and get a rough number of persons that you're shooting for.</p>

546,246080,3,3,sql,EBNF to fluent interface,"<p>I have recently had the need to write a fluent interface for C# that will essentially mirror SQL.

<p>E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>var fq = new FluentQuery();
Expression&lt;Action&gt; =
    () =&gt; fq.SELECT.DISTINCT(Foo.ID).FROM(Foo).WHERE(Foo.Age &gt; 22);

<p>Now, I was thinking that this concept could be generalised--that is, how about a general EBNF to fluent interface generator?  Does anyone know if such a beast exists?</p>
","<p>I like it, but you have to make sure to return types like HasFromAndSelect or something like that so you don't end up with <code>fq.SELECT(Foo.ID).SELECT(Foo.Age).WHERE(Foo.Age &gt; 22)</code> or <code>fq.WHERE(Foo.Age &gt; 22).SELECT(Foo.ID)</code>, etc.</p>

<p>It reminds you about how date/time values are stored (two date/time data types: datetime and smalldatetime)</p>

<p>It also points out Datetime and smalldatetime are like the floating-point data types, float and real, in that theyâre approximate numerics. That means the value retrieved from SQL Server may be different from the value that was originally stored.</p>

<p>Plus, it warns about Database designers who donât always use date/time columns appropriately. At the time the database is designed, each date/time column should be identified as to whether it will store both dates and times, dates only, or times only.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every change you make to the
  database, you write a new migration.
  Migrations typically have two methods:
  an ""up"" method in which the changes
  are applied and a ""down"" method in
  which the changes are undone. A single
  command brings the database up to
  date, and can also be used to bring
  the database to a specific version of
  the schema.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is the following: Is every DDL command in an ""up"" method reversible? In other words, can we always provide a ""down"" method? Can you imagine any DDL command that can not be ""down""ed? </p>

<p>Please, do not consider the typical data migration problem where during the ""up"" method we have loss of data: e.g. changing a field type from <code>datetime</code> (<code>DateOfBirth</code>) to <code>int</code> (<code>YearOfBirth</code>) we are losing data that can not be restored.</p>
","<p>Yes, you've identified cases where you lose data, either by transforming it or simply DROP COLUMN in the ""up"" migration.</p>

<p>Another example is that you could drop a SEQUENCE object, thus losing its state.  The ""down"" migration would recreate the sequence, but it would start over at 1.  This could cause duplicate values to be generated by the sequence.  Not a problem if you're performing a migration on an empty database, and you want the sequence to start at 1 anyway, but if you have some number of rows of data, you'd want the sequence to be reset to the greatest value currently in use, which is hard to do reliably, unless you have an exclusive lock on that table.</p>

<p>Any other DDL that is dependent on the state of data in the database has similar problems.  That's probably not a good schema design in the first place, I'm just trying to think of any cases that fit your question.</p>

874,387850,2,3,sql,How can I make this Ruby on Rails page more efficient?,"<p>I'm building a site where users can track their collection of figures for Dungeons &amp; Dragons (www.ddmdb.com).  The models/relationships involved in this funcitonality are the following:</p>

<p><strong>User:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>id (is this really even needed?)</li>
<li>user_id</li>
<li>miniature_id</li>
<li>have_count</li>
<li>favorite (boolean)</li>
</ul>

<p>The pertinent relationships I have set up are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>User:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>has_many :ownerships</li>
<li>has_many :miniatures, :through => :ownerships, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.have_count > 0""</li>
<li>has_many :favorites, :through => :ownerships, :source => :miniature, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.favorite = true""</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Miniatures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>has_many :ownerships</li>
<li>has_many :owners, :through => :ownerships, :source => :user, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.have_count > 0""</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ownership:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>belongs_to :user</li>
<li>belongs_to :miniature</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a page where user's can both view and update their collection, as well as view other user's collections.  It contains a list of all the miniatures on the site and a text box next to each where the user can enter how many of each miniature they have.  This functionality also exists in sub-lists of miniatures (filtered by type, release, size, rarity, etc.)</p>

<p>When a user creates an account they have no entries in the ownership.  When they use the collection page or sub-list of miniatures to update their collection, I create entries in the ownership table for only the miniatures on the submitting page.  So if it's the full Collection list I update all minis (even if the count is 0) or if it's a sub-list, I only update those miniatures.  So at any time a particular user I may have:
  - no entries in ownership
  - entries for some of the miniatures
  - entries for all the miniatures.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I don't know how to query the database with a LEFT JOIN using a ""Rails method"" so that if a user doesn't have an entry for a miniature in Ownerships it defaults to a have_count of 0.  Currently I query for each user_id/miniature_id combination individually as I loop through all miniatures and it's obviously really inefficient.</p>

<p><strong>View:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% for miniature in @miniatures %&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to miniature.name, miniature %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ""counts[#{miniature.id}]"", get_user_miniature_count(current_user, miniature), :size =&gt; 2 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Helper:</strong></p>

<pre><code>def get_user_miniature_count(user, miniature)
  ownerships = user.ownerships
  ownership = user.ownerships.find_by_miniature_id(miniature.id)
  if ownership.nil?
    return 0
  else
    return ownership.have_count
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>An alternate solution would be creating entries for all miniatures when a user signs up, but then I would also have to add a 0 have_count for all users when a new miniature is added to the database after they sign up.  That seems like it could get a bit complex, but perhaps it's the right way to go?</p>

<p>Is there a way to do the join and supply a default value for miniatures where there's no entries in the Ownership table for that particular user?</p>
","<p>The first thing I would say is that the User model should own the code that works out how many of a given miniature the user owns, since it seems like ""business logic"" rather than view formatting.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to add a method to your User model:</p>

<pre><code>def owns(miniature_id)
  o = ownerships.detect { |o| o.miniature_id == miniature_id }
  (o &amp;&amp; o.have_count) || 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>Dry-coded, ymmv.</p>

<p>Edit:  Note that ownerships is cached by Rails once loaded and detect is not overridden by ActiveRecord like find is, and so acts as you would expect it to on an Array (ie no database operations).</p>

105,38680,0,3,sql,How to provide next page of updated content?,"<p>Feel free to edit the title if you know how to formulate the question better. (Tagging is a problem as well.) The problem may be too difficult in this general form, so let us consider a concrete example.</p>

<p>You get a screenful of stackoverflow questions by requesting <code>/questions ?sort=newest</code> page. Next page link leads to <code>/questions?page=2 &amp;sort=newest</code>. I suppose that at server side, the request is translated into an SQL query with LIMIT clause. Problem with this approach is, that if new question were added while user browses first page, his second page will start with some questions he already saw. (If he has 10 question per page, and 10 new questions happened to be added, heâll get exactly the same content second time!)</p>

<p>Is there an elegant way to solve this common problem? I realize that it is not that big a problem, at least not for stackoverflow, but still.</p>

<p>The best idea I have (apart from storing request history per client) is to use <code>/questions?answer_id=NNN</code> format. Server returns a page that starts with the requested answer, and puts the id of the first answer on the next page into next page link. There must be a way to write SQL for that, right? </p>

<p>Is it how it usually done? Or there is a better way?</p>
","<p>Most web sites I've seen don't solve this problem - they show you a page including some content you've already seen.</p>

<p>You might consider that a feature - when you click ""next"" and see some content you're seen before, it's a signal that you want to go back to the front again because there's some new content.</p>

352,150610,4,3,sql,Selecting unique rows in a set of two possibilities,"<p>The problem itself is simple, but I can't figure out a solution that does it in one query, and here's my ""abstraction"" of the problem to allow for a simpler explanation:</p>

<p><strong>I will let my original explenation stand, but here's a set of sample data and the result i expect:</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so here's some sample data, i separated pairs by a blank line</p>

<pre><code>-------------
| Key |  Col | (Together they from a Unique Pair)
--------------
|  1     Foo |
|  1     Bar |
|            |
|  2     Foo |
|            |
|  3     Bar |
|            |
|  4     Foo |
|  4     Bar |
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>And the result I would expect, <strong>after running the query once</strong>, it need to be able to select this result set in one query:</p>

<pre><code>1 - Foo
2 - Foo
3 - Bar
4 - Foo
</code></pre>

<p><em>Original explenation:</em></p>

<p>I have a table, call it <code>TABLE</code> where I have a two columns say <code>ID</code> and <code>NAME</code> which together form the primary key of the table. Now I want to select something where <code>ID=1</code> and then first checks if it can find a row where <code>NAME</code> has the value ""John"", if ""John"" does not exist it should look for a row where <code>NAME</code> is ""Bruce"" - but only return ""John"" if both ""Bruce"" and ""John"" exists or only ""John"" exists of course.</p>

<p>Also note that it should be able to return several rows per query that match the above criteria but with different ID/Name-combinations of course, and that the above explanation is just a simplification of the real problem.</p>

<p>I could be completely blinded by my own code and line of thought but I just can't figure this out. </p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Ownership:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>belongs_to :user</li>
<li>belongs_to :miniature</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a page where user's can both view and update their collection, as well as view other user's collections.  It contains a list of all the miniatures on the site and a text box next to each where the user can enter how many of each miniature they have.  This functionality also exists in sub-lists of miniatures (filtered by type, release, size, rarity, etc.)</p>

<p>When a user creates an account they have no entries in the ownership.  When they use the collection page or sub-list of miniatures to update their collection, I create entries in the ownership table for only the miniatures on the submitting page.  So if it's the full Collection list I update all minis (even if the count is 0) or if it's a sub-list, I only update those miniatures.  So at any time a particular user I may have:
  - no entries in ownership
  - entries for some of the miniatures
  - entries for all the miniatures.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I don't know how to query the database with a LEFT JOIN using a ""Rails method"" so that if a user doesn't have an entry for a miniature in Ownerships it defaults to a have_count of 0.  Currently I query for each user_id/miniature_id combination individually as I loop through all miniatures and it's obviously really inefficient.</p>

<p><strong>View:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% for miniature in @miniatures %&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to miniature.name, miniature %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ""counts[#{miniature.id}]"", get_user_miniature_count(current_user, miniature), :size =&gt; 2 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Helper:</strong></p>

<pre><code>def get_user_miniature_count(user, miniature)
  ownerships = user.ownerships
  ownership = user.ownerships.find_by_miniature_id(miniature.id)
  if ownership.nil?
    return 0
  else
    return ownership.have_count
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>An alternate solution would be creating entries for all miniatures when a user signs up, but then I would also have to add a 0 have_count for all users when a new miniature is added to the database after they sign up.  That seems like it could get a bit complex, but perhaps it's the right way to go?</p>

<p>Is there a way to do the join and supply a default value for miniatures where there's no entries in the Ownership table for that particular user?</p>
","<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but the way you've specified the relationships seems sufficient for rails to figure out the counts on its own? Have you tried that?</p>

<p>edit:
Re the discussion in the comments...how about this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% ownerships=current_user.ownerships %&gt; 
&lt;% for miniature in @miniatures %&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to miniature.name, miniature %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ""counts[#{miniature.id}]"", get_miniature_count(ownerships, miniature), :size =&gt; 2 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>get_miniature_count()</code> just iterates through the supplied ownerships and returns 0 or the count if the miniature appears in the list? I think this will avoid going back to the DB again in each iteration of the 'for'.</p>

<p>edit 2: I'd also suggest firing up script/console and trying to do what you want in ruby directly, i.e. test for the miniatures membership in the ownerships list thinking in terms of ruby not SQL. Often, rails and activerecord is smart enough to do the necessary SQL black magic for you behind the scenes, given it knows the relationships. If you find a user and then do user.methods you'll see what is available.</p>

901,407320,7,3,sql,"Strange SQL2005 problem. ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions""","<p>I have a problem that seems like its a result of a deadlock-situation. 
Whe are now searching for the root of the problem but meantime we wanted to restart the server and get the customer going.</p>

<p>And now everytime we start the program it just says ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"". We have not changed anything in the program, its compiled and on the customers server, but after the ""possible deadlock""-situation it want go online again.</p>

<p>We have 7 clients (computers) running the program, each client is talking to a webservice on a local server, and the webservice is talking to the sql-server (same machine as webserver). </p>

<p>We have restarted both the sql-server and the iis-server, but not rebooted the server because of other important services running on the server so its the last thing we do.
We can se no locks or anything in the management tab. </p>

<p>So my question is, why does the ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" error comming from one time to another without changing anything in the program and it still lives between sql-restart.</p>

<p>It seems like it happens at the first db-request the program does when it start.</p>

<p>If you need more information just ask. Im puzzled...</p>

<p><strong>More information:</strong>
I dont think I have ""long"" running transactions. The scenario is often that I have a dataset with 20-100 rows (ContractRows) in that Ill do a .Update on the tableAdapter. I also loop throug those 20-100 rows and for some of them Ill create ad-hook-sql-querys (for example if a rented product is marked as returned I create a sql-query to mark the product as returned in the database)</p>

<p>So I do this very simplified:</p>

<pre><code>Create objTransactionObject
Create objtableadapter (objTransactionObject)
for each row in contractDS.contractrows
  if row.isreturned then
    strSQL &amp;= ""update product set instock=1 where prodid="" &amp; row.productid &amp; vbcrlf
 End if
next
objtableadapter.update(contractDS)
objData.ExecuteQuery(strSQL, objTransactionObject)    
if succsesfull 
  objtransactionobject.commit
else
  objtransactionobject.rollback
end if
objTran.Dispose()
</code></pre>

<p>And then Im doing commit or rollback depending on if It went well or not.</p>

<p>Edit: None of the answers have solved the problem, but I'll thank you for the good trouble shooting pointers.</p>

<p>The ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" dissapeared suddenly and now the sql-server just ""goes down"" 4-5 times a day, I guess its a deadlock that does that but I have not the right knowledge to find out and are short on sql-experts who can monitor this for me at the moment. I just restart the sql-server and everything works again. 1 of 10 times I also have to restart the computer. Its really bugging me (and my customers of course).</p>

<p>Anyone knowing a person with <strong>good</strong> knowledge in analyzing troubles with deadlocks or other sql problems in sweden (or everywhere in the world,english speaking)  are free to contact me. I know this is'nt a contact site but I take my chanse to ask the question because I have run out of options, I have spent 3 days and nights optimizing the clients to be sure we close connections and dont do too much stupid things there. Without luck.</p>
","<p>It seems to be that you are sharing connections and creating new transactions on the same open connection (this is the parallel part of the exception you are seeing).</p>

<p>Your example seems to support this as you have no mention of how you acquire the connection in it.</p>

<p>You should do a review of your code and make sure that you are only opening a connection and then disposing of it when you are done (and by all means, use the using statement to make sure that you close the connection), as it seems like you are leaving one open somewhere.</p>

<p>The pertinent relationships I have set up are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>User:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>has_many :ownerships</li>
<li>has_many :miniatures, :through => :ownerships, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.have_count > 0""</li>
<li>has_many :favorites, :through => :ownerships, :source => :miniature, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.favorite = true""</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Miniatures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>has_many :ownerships</li>
<li>has_many :owners, :through => :ownerships, :source => :user, :uniq => true, :conditions => ""ownerships.have_count > 0""</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ownership:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>belongs_to :user</li>
<li>belongs_to :miniature</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a page where user's can both view and update their collection, as well as view other user's collections.  It contains a list of all the miniatures on the site and a text box next to each where the user can enter how many of each miniature they have.  This functionality also exists in sub-lists of miniatures (filtered by type, release, size, rarity, etc.)</p>

<p>When a user creates an account they have no entries in the ownership.  When they use the collection page or sub-list of miniatures to update their collection, I create entries in the ownership table for only the miniatures on the submitting page.  So if it's the full Collection list I update all minis (even if the count is 0) or if it's a sub-list, I only update those miniatures.  So at any time a particular user I may have:
  - no entries in ownership
  - entries for some of the miniatures
  - entries for all the miniatures.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I don't know how to query the database with a LEFT JOIN using a ""Rails method"" so that if a user doesn't have an entry for a miniature in Ownerships it defaults to a have_count of 0.  Currently I query for each user_id/miniature_id combination individually as I loop through all miniatures and it's obviously really inefficient.</p>

<p><strong>View:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% for miniature in @miniatures %&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to miniature.name, miniature %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ""counts[#{miniature.id}]"", get_user_miniature_count(current_user, miniature), :size =&gt; 2 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Helper:</strong></p>

<pre><code>def get_user_miniature_count(user, miniature)
  ownerships = user.ownerships
  ownership = user.ownerships.find_by_miniature_id(miniature.id)
  if ownership.nil?
    return 0
  else
    return ownership.have_count
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>An alternate solution would be creating entries for all miniatures when a user signs up, but then I would also have to add a 0 have_count for all users when a new miniature is added to the database after they sign up.  That seems like it could get a bit complex, but perhaps it's the right way to go?</p>

<p>Is there a way to do the join and supply a default value for miniatures where there's no entries in the Ownership table for that particular user?</p>
","<p>Using fd's suggestion and information found at <a href=""http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/52385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/52385</a>, I created the following method:</p>

<pre><code>def miniature_count(miniature_id)
  if @counts.nil?
    @counts = Hash.new
    ownerships.collect{|o| @counts[o.miniature_id] = o.have_count }
  end
  count = @counts[miniature_id] || 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>This ends up being faster than the <em>detect</em> approach.</p>

<p>I picked *miniature_count* over <em>owns</em> for the name because <em>owns</em> sounds like a method that should return a boolean instead of an integer.</p>

","<p>Dan -- not sure if this will work without testing, but its worth a shot.  I guess your already have the Ids that you want to add to your C -- so set your associations (many-to-one I'm assuming) to insert=""false"" and update=""false"" (maybe cascade=""none"" would work alternatively as well).  Then create an ""empty copy"" of your A and B entities, add the Ids to them, add them to C and try to save C (Session.SaveOrUpdateCopy(C)).  Hopefully NHibernate will not attempt to add a new A and B object into their respective table, but will simply set the correct Ids within the C table -- this way you don't have to load the A and B entities.</p>

<p>The bad part is, if you have to save or update A and B, you'll have to do it directly. The other bad part is that I don't have time to test this, so I don't know if it will work.</p>

900,407320,0,3,sql,"Strange SQL2005 problem. ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions""","<p>I have a problem that seems like its a result of a deadlock-situation. 
Whe are now searching for the root of the problem but meantime we wanted to restart the server and get the customer going.</p>

<p>And now everytime we start the program it just says ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"". We have not changed anything in the program, its compiled and on the customers server, but after the ""possible deadlock""-situation it want go online again.</p>

<p>We have 7 clients (computers) running the program, each client is talking to a webservice on a local server, and the webservice is talking to the sql-server (same machine as webserver). </p>

<p>We have restarted both the sql-server and the iis-server, but not rebooted the server because of other important services running on the server so its the last thing we do.
We can se no locks or anything in the management tab. </p>

<p>So my question is, why does the ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" error comming from one time to another without changing anything in the program and it still lives between sql-restart.</p>

<p>It seems like it happens at the first db-request the program does when it start.</p>

<p>If you need more information just ask. Im puzzled...</p>

<p><strong>More information:</strong>
I dont think I have ""long"" running transactions. The scenario is often that I have a dataset with 20-100 rows (ContractRows) in that Ill do a .Update on the tableAdapter. I also loop throug those 20-100 rows and for some of them Ill create ad-hook-sql-querys (for example if a rented product is marked as returned I create a sql-query to mark the product as returned in the database)</p>

<p>So I do this very simplified:</p>

<pre><code>Create objTransactionObject
Create objtableadapter (objTransactionObject)
for each row in contractDS.contractrows
  if row.isreturned then
    strSQL &amp;= ""update product set instock=1 where prodid="" &amp; row.productid &amp; vbcrlf
 End if
next
objtableadapter.update(contractDS)
objData.ExecuteQuery(strSQL, objTransactionObject)    
if succsesfull 
  objtransactionobject.commit
else
  objtransactionobject.rollback
end if
objTran.Dispose()
</code></pre>

<p>And then Im doing commit or rollback depending on if It went well or not.</p>

<p>Edit: None of the answers have solved the problem, but I'll thank you for the good trouble shooting pointers.</p>

<p>The ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" dissapeared suddenly and now the sql-server just ""goes down"" 4-5 times a day, I guess its a deadlock that does that but I have not the right knowledge to find out and are short on sql-experts who can monitor this for me at the moment. I just restart the sql-server and everything works again. 1 of 10 times I also have to restart the computer. Its really bugging me (and my customers of course).</p>

<p>Anyone knowing a person with <strong>good</strong> knowledge in analyzing troubles with deadlocks or other sql problems in sweden (or everywhere in the world,english speaking)  are free to contact me. I know this is'nt a contact site but I take my chanse to ask the question because I have run out of options, I have spent 3 days and nights optimizing the clients to be sure we close connections and dont do too much stupid things there.

Whe are now searching for the root of the problem but meantime we wanted to restart the server and get the customer going.</p>

<p>And now everytime we start the program it just says ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"". We have not changed anything in the program, its compiled and on the customers server, but after the ""possible deadlock""-situation it want go online again.</p>

<p>We have 7 clients (computers) running the program, each client is talking to a webservice on a local server, and the webservice is talking to the sql-server (same machine as webserver). </p>

<p>We have restarted both the sql-server and the iis-server, but not rebooted the server because of other important services running on the server so its the last thing we do.
We can se no locks or anything in the management tab. </p>

<p>So my question is, why does the ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" error comming from one time to another without changing anything in the program and it still lives between sql-restart.</p>

<p>It seems like it happens at the first db-request the program does when it start.</p>

<p>If you need more information just ask. Im puzzled...</p>

<p><strong>More information:</strong>
I dont think I have ""long"" running transactions. The scenario is often that I have a dataset with 20-100 rows (ContractRows) in that Ill do a .Update on the tableAdapter. I also loop throug those 20-100 rows and for some of them Ill create ad-hook-sql-querys (for example if a rented product is marked as returned I create a sql-query to mark the product as returned in the database)</p>

<p>So I do this very simplified:</p>

<pre><code>Create objTransactionObject
Create objtableadapter (objTransactionObject)
for each row in contractDS.contractrows
  if row.isreturned then
    strSQL &amp;= ""update product set instock=1 where prodid="" &amp; row.productid &amp; vbcrlf

next
objtableadapter.update(contractDS)
objData.ExecuteQuery(strSQL, objTransactionObject)    
if succsesfull 
  objtransactionobject.commit
else
  objtransactionobject.rollback
end if
objTran.Dispose()
</code></pre>

<p>And then Im doing commit or rollback depending on if It went well or not.</p>

<p>Edit: None of the answers have solved the problem, but I'll thank you for the good trouble shooting pointers.</p>

<p>The ""SqlConnection does not support parallel transactions"" dissapeared suddenly and now the sql-server just ""goes down"" 4-5 times a day, I guess its a deadlock that does that but I have not the right knowledge to find out and are short on sql-experts who can monitor this for me at the moment. I just restart the sql-server and everything works again. 1 of 10 times I also have to restart the computer. Its really bugging me (and my customers of course).</p>

<p>I have a database containing stock price history. I want to select most recent prices for every stock that is listed. I know PostreSQL has a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25224/joining-latest-of-various-usermetadata-tags-to-user-rows#27159"">DISTINCT ON</a> statement that would suit ideally here.</p>

<p>Table columns are <code>name</code>, <code>closingPrice</code> and <code>date</code>; <code>name</code> and <code>date</code> together form a unique index.</p>

<p>The <em>easiest</em> (and very uneffective) way is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM stockPrices s
WHERE s.date =
(SELECT MAX(date) FROM stockPrices si WHERE si.name = s.name);
</code></pre>

<p>Much better approach I found is</p>

FROM stockPrices s JOIN (
  SELECT name, MAX(date) AS date

  GROUP BY name
) lastEntry ON s.name = lastEntry.name AND s.date = lastEntry.date;

<p>I have a database containing stock price history. I want to select most recent prices for every stock that is listed. I know PostreSQL has a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25224/joining-latest-of-various-usermetadata-tags-to-user-rows#27159"">DISTINCT ON</a> statement that would suit ideally here.</p>

<p>Table columns are <code>name</code>, <code>closingPrice</code> and <code>date</code>; <code>name</code> and <code>date</code> together form a unique index.</p>

<p>The <em>easiest</em> (and very uneffective) way is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM stockPrices s
WHERE s.date =
(SELECT MAX(date) FROM stockPrices si WHERE si.name = s.name);
</code></pre>

<p>Much better approach I found is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM stockPrices s JOIN (
  SELECT name, MAX(date) AS date
  FROM stockPrices si
  GROUP BY name
) lastEntry ON s.name = lastEntry.name AND s.date = lastEntry.date;
</code></pre>

<p>What would be an efficient way to do this? What indexes should I create?</p>

","<p>You may not like to hear this, but it might be better for you to go back to dynamically constructing your SQL query in code before issuing against the database. If you use parameter placeholders in the SQL string you get the protection against SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>string sql  = ""SELECT Name, Title FROM Staff WHERE UserName=@UserId"";
using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(sql))
{
  cmd.Parameters.Add(""@UserId"", SqlType.VarChar).Value = ""smithj"";
</code></pre>

<p>You can build the SQL string depending on the set of columns you need to query and then add the parameter values once the string is complete. This is a bit of a pain to do, but I think it is much easier than having really complicated TSQL which unpicks lots of possible permutations of possible inputs.</p>

<p>In certain cases the subquery:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>to prevent the user from seeing an error when/if (hopefully never) this situation arises or let the error come through.  I'm leaning to not adding the top statement and letting the error come through rather then let the user see potentially incorrect data.  I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on Best Practices in a situation like this...</p>
","<p>Coding Practice: Placing top1 in a subquery which is required to return a single value.</p>

<li>Stops looking for new values when the first Value has been found (performant).</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prevents the query from complaining about significant Extra Values.</li>

","<p>As a rule we do all of our database interactions via stored procedures instead of direct SQL statements; this allows a lot of flexibility for adjusting to schema changes and performance issues without having to rebuild or redeploy binary images or configuration files to all targets.</p>

","<p>The fact that you have foreign key relationships between your tables does not mean that you have to create your data in a particular order. Normally, one would expect the Vehicle record to be created first, and then have engines and gears assigned to it later, but this does not have to be the case.</p>

<p>If, in your scenario, it is possible for engines or gears to be recorded in the database, before being assigned to a vehicle, then you will need to make the FK columns which reference Vehicle ID allow nulls. These can then be linked to a vehicle id once the vehicle row has been created.</p>

","<p>I have to say that personally I believe this scenario doesn't make sense, really.</p>

<p>In order for a gear or engine to exist, you need a vehicle.  Your business rules/Domain Model should really enforce that, and the foreign key relationships are then just a way of validating this is the case.</p>

<p>Alternatively it might be better to think of the engine-vehicle relationship as a many-many.  For this you need an additional table to link the vehicle and engine.  This would mean you can have foreign key constraints, but it also means that an engine can be linked to many cars, and vice versa.  This more realistically models the real-world, where the same engine is used in many models of car, and a car may have a variety of engines to chose from.</p>

","<p>Using VBA seems like the way to go to me. This lets you write a macro that takes care of all of the various formatting options and should, hopefully, be simple enough for your finance people to run themselves.</p>

<p>You said you need something that takes a sheet or range in Excel. The first column never changes so we can store that in the macro, columns 3-7 come from the spreadsheet and column 8 is just blank. That leaves column 2 (the quarter/year as QYY) as an issue. If the quarter/year is specified somewhere in the workbook (e.g. stored in a cell, as a worksheet name, as part of the workbook title) then we can just read it in. Otherwise you will need to find some method for specifying the quarter/year when the macro runs (e.g. pop up a dialog box and ask the user to input it)</p>

<p>Some simple code (we'll worry about how to call this later):</p>

<pre><code>Sub ProduceStatePayrollReportFile(rngPayrollData As Range, strCompanyNo As String, _
    strQuarterYear As String, strRecordCode As String, strOutputFile As String)
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters are fairly obvious: the range that holds the data, the company number for column 1, the quarter/year for column 2, the fixed code for column 7 and the file we want to output the results to</p>

<pre><code>' Store the file handle for the output file
Dim fnOutPayrollReport As Integer
' Store each line of the output file
Dim strPayrollReportLine As String
' Use to work through each row in the range
Dim indexRow As Integer
</code></pre>

<p>To output to a file in VBA we need to get a file handle so we need a variable to store that in. We'll build up each line of the report in the report line string and use the row index to work through the range</p>

<pre><code>' Store the raw SSN, last name, first name and wages data
Dim strRawSSN As String
Dim strRawLastName As String
Dim strRawFirstName As String
Dim strRawWages As String
Dim currencyRawWages As Currency

' Store the corrected SSN, last name, first name and wages data
Dim strCleanSSN As String
Dim strCleanLastName As String
Dim strCleanFirstName As String
Dim strCleanWages As String
</code></pre>

<p>These sets of variables store the raw data from the worksheet and the cleaned data to be output to the file respectively. Naming them ""raw"" and ""clean"" makes it easier to spot errors where you accidentally output raw data instead of cleaned data. We will need to change the raw wages from a string value to a numeric value to help with the formatting</p>

<pre><code>' Open up the output file
fnOutPayrollReport = FreeFile()
Open strOutputFile For Output As #fnOutPayrollReport
</code></pre>

<p>FreeFile() gets the next available file handle and we use that to link to the file</p>

<pre><code>' Work through each row in the range
For indexRow = 1 To rngPayrollData.Rows.Count
    ' Reset the output report line to be empty
    strPayrollReportLine = """"
    ' Add the company number to the report line (assumption: already correctly formatted)
    strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strCompanyNo
    ' Add in the quarter/year (assumption: already correctly formatted)
    strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strQuarterYear
</code></pre>

<p>In our loop to work through each row, we start by clearing out the output string and then adding in the values for columns 1 and 2</p>

<pre><code>' Get the raw SSN data, clean it and append to the report line
strRawSSN = rngPayrollData.Cells(indexRow, 1)
strCleanSSN = cleanFromRawSSN(strRawSSN)
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strCleanSSN
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.Cells(indexRow, 1)</code> part just means the left-most column of the range at the row specified by indexRow. If the ranges starts in column A (which does not have to be the case) then this just means A. We'll need to write the <code>cleanFromRawSSN</code> function ourselves later</p>

<pre><code>' Get the raw last and first names, clean them and append them
strRawLastName = rngPayrollData.Cells(indexRow, 2)
strCleanLastName = Format(Left$(strRawLastName, 10), ""!@@@@@@@@@@"")
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strCleanLastName

strRawFirstName = rngPayrollData.Cells(indexRow, 3)
strCleanFirstName = Format(Left$(strRawFirstName, 8), ""!@@@@@@@@"")
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strCleanFirstName
</code></pre>

<p><code>Left$(string, length)</code> truncates the string to the given length. The format picture <code>!@@@@@@@@@@</code> formats a string as exactly ten characters long, left justified (the ! signifies left justify) and padded with spaces</p>

<pre><code>' Read in the wages data, convert to numeric data, lose the decimal, clean it and append it
strRawWages = rngPayrollData.Cells(indexRow, 4)
currencyRawWages = CCur(strRawWages)
currencyRawWages = currencyRawWages * 100
strCleanWages = Format(currencyRawWages, ""000000000"")
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strCleanWages
</code></pre>

<p>We convert it to currency so that we can multiply by 100 to move the cents value to the left of the decimal point. This makes it much easier to use <code>Format</code> to generate the correct value. This will not produce correct output for wages >= $10 million but that's a limitation of the file format used for reporting. The <code>0</code> in the format picture pads with 0s surprisingly enough</p>

<pre><code>' Append the fixed code for column 7 and the spaces for column 8
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; strRecordCode
strPayrollReportLine = strPayrollReportLine &amp; CStr(String(29, "" ""))

' Output the line to the file
Print #fnOutPayrollReport, strPayrollReportLine
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>String(number, char)</code> function produces a Variant with a sequence of <code>number</code> of the specified <code>char</code>. <code>CStr</code> turns the Variant into a string. The <code>Print #</code> statement outputs to the file without any additional formatting</p>

<pre><code>Next indexRow

' Close the file
Close #fnOutPayrollReport

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Loop round to the next row in the range and repeat. When we have processed all of the rows, close the file and end the macro</p>

<p>We still need two things: a cleanFromRawSSN function and a way to call the macro with the relevant data.</p>

<pre><code>Function cleanFromRawSSN(strRawSSN As String) As String

' Used to index the raw SSN so we can process it one character at a time
Dim indexRawChar As Integer

' Set the return string to be empty
cleanFromRawSSN = """"

' Loop through the raw data and extract the correct characters
For indexRawChar = 1 To Len(strRawSSN)
    ' Check for hyphen
    If (Mid$(strRawSSN, indexRawChar, 1) = ""-"") Then
        ' do nothing
    ' Check for space
    ElseIf (Mid$(strRawSSN, indexRawChar, 1) = "" "") Then
        ' do nothing
    Else
        ' Output character
        cleanFromRawSSN = cleanFromRawSSN &amp; Mid$(strRawSSN, indexRawChar, 1)
    End If
Next indexRawChar

' Check for correct length and return empty string if incorrect
If (Len(cleanFromRawSSN) &lt;&gt; 9) Then
    cleanFromRawSSN = """"
End If

End Function
</code></pre>

<p><code>Len</code> returns the length of a string and <code>Mid$(string, start, length)</code> returns <code>length</code> characters from <code>string</code> beginning at <code>start</code>. This function could be improved as it doesn't currently check for non-numeric data</p>

<p>To call the macro:</p>

<pre><code>Sub CallPayrollReport()

ProduceStatePayrollReportFile Application.Selection, ""1234560007"", ""109"", ""01"", ""C:\payroll109.txt""

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest way to call it. The Range is whatever the user has selected on the active worksheet in the active workbook and the other values are hard-coded. The user should select the range they want to output to the file then go Tools > Macro > Run and choose <code>CallPayrollReport</code>. For this to work, the macro would either need to be part of the workbook containg the data or in a different workbook which had been loaded before the user calls the macro.</p>

<p>Someone would need to change the hard-coded value of the quarter/year before each quarter's report was generated. As stated earlier, if the quarter/year is already stored in the workbook somewhere then it's better to read that in rather than hard-coding it</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense and is of some use</p>

1029,480730,3,2,sql,How do I get a count of items in one column that match items in another column?,"<p>Assume I have two data tables and a linking table as such:</p>

<pre>

A         B         A_B_Link          
-----     -----     -----
ID        ID        A_ID
Name      Name      B_ID

</pre>

<p>2 Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to write a query so that I have all of A's columns and a count of how many B's are linked to A, what is the best way to do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a way to have a query return a row with all of the columns from A and a column containing <em>all</em> of linked names from B (maybe separated by some delimiter?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <strong>the query must return distinct rows from A</strong>, so a simple left outer join is not going to work here...I'm guessing I'll need nested select statements?</p>
","<p>For your first question:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT A.ID, A.Name, COUNT(ab.B_ID) AS bcount
FROM A LEFT JOIN A_B_Link ab ON (ab.A_ID = A.ID)
GROUP BY A.ID, A.Name;
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs one row per row of A, with the count of matching B's.  Note that you must list all columns of A in the GROUP BY statement; there's no way to use a wildcard here.</p>

<p>An alternate solution is to use a correlated subquery, as @Ray Booysen shows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT A.*, 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM A_B_Link 
   WHERE A_B_Link.A_ID = A.A_ID) AS bcount
FROM A;
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but correlated subqueries aren't very good for performance.</p>

<p>For your second question, you need something like MySQL's <code>GROUP_CONCAT()</code> aggregate function.  In MySQL, you can get a comma-separated list of <code>B.Name</code> per row of A like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT A.*, GROUP_CONCAT(B.Name) AS bname_list
FROM A 
  LEFT OUTER JOIN A_B_Link ab ON (A.ID = ab.A_ID)
  LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON (ab.B_ID = B.ID)
GROUP BY A.ID;
</code></pre>

999,460300,1,2,sql,Storing Queries in C# or use Stored Functions in Postgres?,"<p>Should I be storing the raw SQL queries in my c# code, or should I be delegating them to stored functions in the Postgres Backend?</p>

<p>If I should be storing them in code, since they can get quite long, what is the optimal way to store them (ie. as constants in a separate static class)?</p>

<p>Does using stored functions have any impact on deployability/updatability of an application?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I quite like storing SQL in text files embedded as resources into the assembly (when I absolutely <em>have</em> to have a significant number of them; I'm an ORM man normally).</p>

<p>Quite how you format that text file is up to you, of course. You could have double-line-break delimited:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateCustomer:
UPDATE CUSTOMER SET NAME=@Name WHERE ID=@ID

FindCustomer:
SELECT NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE ID=@Id

etc
</code></pre>

<p>It's not hard to then have a class which loads that into a <code>Dictionary&lt;string,string&gt;</code> in a type initialier, or even a <code>Dictionary&lt;string,SqlStatementHelper&gt;</code> where the latter is a class to make it easy to prepare the statement with appropriate values. You could use any other format you want though, including XML - although if you didn't need anything else beyond the name/sql pairs, that would probably be overkill.</p>

<p>The downside of this is the disconnect between the SQL and the code that uses it - you can't instantly tell what the parameters are without looking at the text file. On the other hand (and I'm just thinking off the cuff here) you probably <em>could</em> autogenerate a class from the SQL (and a bit of metadata) with methods with strongly typed parameters.</p>

<p>The mixed blessing of stored procs is that they live in the database rather than in your code. The upside of this is that you're more likely to keep them in sync with DDL changes. The downside is that they're more effort to change (IME, anyway) than queries defined locally. (There are obviously plenty of other pros and cons, but I'm limiting myself to the convenience side here.)</p>

<p>As for maintenance - well, I suppose it's possible that you'd have a ""database only"" update of just tables and stored procs, without any clients having to know at all - in which case the stored procs would be a better move. In my experience (certainly with custom solutions where there are only a couple of applications accessing the database, so compatibility isn't <em>as</em> much of an issue) code changes are almost ubiquitous but database changes less so - at which point storing the queries with the application means you're less likely to have to do a database change when you update. Does any of that make sense? I haven't had coffee yet...</p>

","<p>Whichever, there's no need to create rows in any of the tables for which you don't have data. It's fine to, for instance, have an engine row that is unmatched to a vehicle. You can add what's missing when you find it.</p>

<p>I think I understand the design. Each vehicle can have one engine and one transmission. But you may record the transmission or engine before you find the vehicle.</p>

<p>They really are separate entities, so treat them as such. You may easily end up with engines and transmissions which you never match to a vehicle.</p>

<p>Another more interesting question is whether you might end up with a transmission matched to an engine, but no vehicle. One often sees an engine and tramsission bolted together with no vehicle in sight. And they'll often be sold together as well.</p>

<p>In fact, you can imagine any of the three existing alone, or matched to one or two of the other entities.</p>

<p>Triggers have no role here. If used at all, triggers should be restricted to fine-grained referential integrity rules about the schema structure - not for business rules like this. There are no mandatory constraints - every foreign key is optional (nullable). And there are several different ways to set the FK fields up.</p>

","<p>Wow!  </p>

<p>I have to say, I am blown away.  You so far exceeded my expectations for an answer that I feel guilty that I can ONLY up vote you once and mark as excepted.  I had HOPED for so guidance towards which path was best and some formatting.  Well Happy Birthday to me!</p>

<p>The Format() and FreeFile() were especially new useful info.  Also, just to show that I was trying, my attempt is below.  I was quite close as I was just working out the formatting details but I believe I shall rework it with your input as it seems the more elegant approach.</p>

<p>As a final note.  I found this place thru Jeff Atwood's blog and I was truly excited by the idea.  As a new, inexperienced developer in a solo shop I had always wished there was someplace I could turn for mentorship.  Books and articles get you to a point but nothing equals the advice of someone who's done it or been there.  So far StackOverflow has delivered.  </p>

559,251050,3,2,sql,Is it possible to execute SQL commands and send MSMQ messages in a TransactionScope?,"<p>I'm investigating using MSMQ for my team's new project but I need to know if I can send MSMQ messages and execute SQL commands within a System.Transactions.TransactionScope and have them commit or rollback together. I can't find a reliable source online that says ""yes"" with code examples. </p>

<p>I need to send some messages to a single queue and insert some records in a single database, but I need to to succeed or fail together.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was not able to actually verify whether this works or not in my testing (I was pulled off this task quickly) but all the documentation states that TransactionScope does capture MSMQ messages and SQL commands in the same instance.</p>
","<p>From personal experience I know the TransactionScope works great with SQL. I'm not too familiar with MSMQ but a quick <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=msmq+transactionscope"" rel=""nofollow"">Google search</a> shows some examples (normally forum discussions) where it looks like it's working successfully. The System.Messaging.MessageQueue object also has a .Transactional property and the .Send() method has a MessageQueueTransaction parameter so I'd say it should all work together.</p>

<p>Here's the code example from one of the forums in the search (not my code):</p>

<pre><code>using (TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope())  
{  
    using (MessageQueue myQueue = new MessageQueue(QUEUE_NAME))  
    {  
    if (myQueue.Transactional)  
        {  
        myQueue.Send(TicketTextBox.Text, ""Message"", MessageQueueTransactionType.Automatic);  
        }  
    }  
scope.Complete();  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just throw your SQL code inside the using() block for the TransactionScope (before the .Complete()) and you should be good to go?</p>

","<p>You can't <code>SELECT</code> from a table (even in a subquery) that you're updating in the same query.  That's what the error ""can't specify target table"" means.</p>

<p>But you can join <code>user</code> and <code>lessonstatus</code> multiple times in the <code>UPDATE</code> statement, and use the join criteria creatively to pick out the individual row you want.</p>

<p>No need to be generic, just say what <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980813/what-is-sgbd"">SGBD</a> your solution is specific to if not generic.</p>
","<p>Ok, this is a bit beyond geeky, but I built a web application to track my wife's contractions just before we had a baby so that I could see from work when it was getting close to time to go to the hospital.  Anyway, I built this basic thing fairly easily as two views.</p>

<pre><code>create table contractions time_date timestamp primary key;

create view contraction_time as
SELECT a.time_date, max(b.prev_time) AS prev_time
   FROM contractions a, ( SELECT contractions.time_date AS prev_time
           FROM contractions) b
  WHERE b.prev_time &lt; a.time_date
  GROUP BY a.time_date;

create view time_between as 
SELECT contraction_time.time_date, contraction_time.prev_time, contraction_time.time_date - contraction_time.prev_time
   FROM contraction_time;

398,181130,1,2,sql,Encrypted database query,"<p>I've just found out about Stack Overflow and I'm just checking if there are ideas for a constraint I'm having with some friends in a project, though this is more of a theoretical question to which I've been trying to find an answer for some time.</p>

<p>I'm not much given into cryptography but if I'm not clear enough I'll try to edit/comment to clarify any questions.</p>

<p>Trying to be brief, the environment is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An application where the front-end as access to encrypt/decrypt keys and the back-end is just used for storage and queries.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a database to which you can't have access for a couple of fields for example let's say ""address"" which is text/varchar as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't have access to the key for decrypting the information, and all information arrives to the database already encrypted.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main problem is something like this, how to consistently make queries on the database, it's impossible to do stuff like ""where address like '%FÂ§YU/Â´~#JKSks23%'"". (IF there is anyone  feeling with an answer for this feel free to shoot it).</p>

<p>But is it ok to do <code>where address='Â±!NNsj3~^Âº-:'</code>? Or would it also completely eat up the database? </p>

<p>Another restrain that might apply is that the front end doesn't have much processing power available, so already encrypting/decrypting information starts to push it to its limits. (Saying this just to avoid replies like ""Exporting a join of tables to the front end and query it there"".)</p>

<p>Could someone point me in a direction to keep thinking about it?</p>

<hr>

<p>Well thanks for so fast replies at 4 AM, for a first time usage I'm really feeling impressed with this community. (Or maybe I'm it's just for the different time zone)</p>

<p>Just feeding some information:</p>

<p>The main problem is all around partial matching. As a mandatory requirement in most databases is to allow partial matches. The main constraint is actually <strong>the database owner would not be allowed to look inside the database for information</strong>. During the last 10 minutes I've come up with a possible solution which extends again to possible database problems, to which I'll add here:</p>

<p>Possible solution to allow semi partial matching:</p>

<ul>
<li>The password + a couple of public fields of the user are actually the key for encrypting. For authentication the idea is to encrypt a static value and compare it within the database.</li>
<li>Creating a new set of tables where information is stored in a parsed way, meaning something like: ""4th Street"" would become 2 encrypted rows (one for '4th' another for 'Street'). This would already allow semi-partial matching as a search could already be performed on the separate tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>New question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would this probably eat up the database server again, or does anyone think it is a viable solution for the partial matching problem?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Post Scriptum: I've unaccepted the answer from Cade Roux just to allow for further discussion and specially a possible answer to the new question.</em></p>
","<p>A few months ago I came across the same problem: the whole database (except for indexes) is encrypted and the problem on partial matches raised up.</p>

<p>I searched the Internet looking for a solution, but it seems that there's not much to do about this but a ""workaround"".</p>

<p>The solution I've finally adopted is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a temporary table with the data of the field against which the query is being performed, decrypted and another field that is the primary key of the table (obviously, this field doesn't have to be decrypted as is plain-text).</p></li>
<li><p>Perform the partial match agains that temporary table and retrieve the identifiers.</p></li>
<li><p>Query the real table for those identifiers and return the result.</p></li>
<li><p>Drop the temporary table.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am aware that this supposes a non-trivial overhead, but I haven't found another way to perform this task when it is mandatory that the database is fully encrypted.</p>

<p>Depending on each particular case, you may be able to filter the number of lines that are inserted into the temporary table without losing data for the result (only consider those rows which belong to the user that is performing the query, etc...).</p>

1217,542760,1,2,sql,I have StartDate and EndDate for each record. Should I give NULL a special meaning when used in these 2 fields?,"<p>So, I have a table where StartDate and EndDate's are used to determine the activeness of a record. I thought of using NULLs to relieve the maintainers from having to manufacture some crazy dates for some of the records.

<p>I can speculate some of the trade offs on my own: defining NULL as infinities means cleaner data and elimination of periodic maintenance work, but it also means longer queries and stored procedures. So I was wondering how you guys in the real world weigh in on this. </p>

<p>EDIT: the opinions are about half-half. If I had clarified that the StartDate and EndDate are used solely for the purpose of determining the activeness of a record in the where clause, and never appears in the select list, would that tilt the scale? One subject I need to read on is probably indexing. Thanks'all. </p>
","<p>I'd try to work with NULL values as long as possible.</p>

<p>My understanding of NULL in a column EndDate would be that there is not defined an end date as of now. That would be consistent with that record being valid from its start date to its end date.</p>

<p>I agree with Quassnoi that you can't directly specify </p>

<pre><code>BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
</code></pre>

<p>but instead of his suggestion (which makes using indices/indexes difficult), this one works as well:</p>

<pre><code>(somedate &gt;= StartDate or StartDate is null)
AND
(somedate &lt;= EndDate or EndDate is null)
</code></pre>

<p>AFAIK this would allow usage of an index, but check the execution plan for your specific circumstances.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of using ""special"" start/end dates instead is enforceability. If all your DB access is through a specific program language with more or less mandatory libraries, you may be able to make this work. If however, you have different access paths (direct SQL, different languages/libraries) this would be very hard to do. </p>

<p>There may be a third way: Using NULLs for DML statements and then have a trigger change that to a predefined min/max value. Then Selects might be easier. But using a trigger is opening another can of worms ...</p>

<p>My conclusion: This scenario is a decent use for a database NULL. In my experience, I have not yet run into serious performance problems. But I agreee that the extra NULL handling is a bit of nuisance.</p>

<b>@ MBCook</b> - great link, wish I had posted that myself - thanks</p>

<p>Update: Once a query or function has a Null for that date then you no longer know if the Null was assigned because of it means Max or because a Null was propagated up the query.  </p>

1215,542760,0,2,sql,I have StartDate and EndDate for each record. Should I give NULL a special meaning when used in these 2 fields?,"<p>So, I have a table where StartDate and EndDate's are used to determine the activeness of a record. I thought of using NULLs to relieve the maintainers from having to manufacture some crazy dates for some of the records.

<p>I can speculate some of the trade offs on my own: defining NULL as infinities means cleaner data and elimination of periodic maintenance work, but it also means longer queries and stored procedures. So I was wondering how you guys in the real world weigh in on this. </p>

<p>EDIT: the opinions are about half-half. If I had clarified that the StartDate and EndDate are used solely for the purpose of determining the activeness of a record in the where clause, and never appears in the select list, would that tilt the scale?

532,235690,3,2,sql,Is it possible to change SQL user-defined data type?,"<p>I have a bunch of tables using user-defined data type for PK column. Is it possible to change this type Using SQL Server 2005?</p>
","<p>I would suggest that it is always possible to refactor poor or outmoded database designs, it simply depends on how much work you are willing to go to in order to do so.</p>

<p>If you are looking to replace the user-defined data with a surrogate key then you should be able to simply alter the existing table to contain a non-nullable identity column and this should cause all of the existing records to be assigned a new key automatically.</p>

<p>Once the new field is populated with unique id's, if you need to move out and replace foreign key references to this table, then I would simply alter those tables to contain the new field and use something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE child_table 
SET new_fk_val = 
    SELECT new_pk_val 
    FROM parent_table
    WHERE parent_table.old_pk_val = child_table.old_fk_val
</code></pre>

<p>Once that step is complete, then you could drop the old foreign key constraint, drop the old foreign key column, drop the old primary key column, establish the new primary key constraint, and then establish the new foreign key constraint.</p>

<p>Of course, if the old version of the parent and child tables relationship was such that you have invalid records in the child table you may have to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM child_table 
WHERE old_fk_val NOT IN 
    ( SELECT old_pk_val FROM parent_table)

397,181130,2,2,sql,Encrypted database query,"<p>I've just found out about Stack Overflow and I'm just checking if there are ideas for a constraint I'm having with some friends in a project, though this is more of a theoretical question to which I've been trying to find an answer for some time.</p>

<p>I'm not much given into cryptography but if I'm not clear enough I'll try to edit/comment to clarify any questions.</p>

<p>Trying to be brief, the environment is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An application where the front-end as access to encrypt/decrypt keys and the back-end is just used for storage and queries.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a database to which you can't have access for a couple of fields for example let's say ""address"" which is text/varchar as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't have access to the key for decrypting the information, and all information arrives to the database already encrypted.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main problem is something like this, how to consistently make queries on the database, it's impossible to do stuff like ""where address like '%FÂ§YU/Â´~#JKSks23%'"". (IF there is anyone  feeling with an answer for this feel free to shoot it).</p>

<p>But is it ok to do <code>where address='Â±!NNsj3~^Âº-:'</code>? Or would it also completely eat up the database? </p>

<p>Another restrain that might apply is that the front end doesn't have much processing power available, so already encrypting/decrypting information starts to push it to its limits. (Saying this just to avoid replies like ""Exporting a join of tables to the front end and query it there"".)</p>

<p>Could someone point me in a direction to keep thinking about it?</p>

<hr>

<p>Well thanks for so fast replies at 4 AM, for a first time usage I'm really feeling impressed with this community. (Or maybe I'm it's just for the different time zone)</p>

<p>Just feeding some information:</p>

<p>The main problem is all around partial matching. As a mandatory requirement in most databases is to allow partial matches. The main constraint is actually <strong>the database owner would not be allowed to look inside the database for information</strong>. During the last 10 minutes I've come up with a possible solution which extends again to possible database problems, to which I'll add here:</p>

<p>Possible solution to allow semi partial matching:</p>

<ul>
<li>The password + a couple of public fields of the user are actually the key for encrypting. For authentication the idea is to encrypt a static value and compare it within the database.</li>
<li>Creating a new set of tables where information is stored in a parsed way, meaning something like: ""4th Street"" would become 2 encrypted rows (one for '4th' another for 'Street'). This would already allow semi-partial matching as a search could already be performed on the separate tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>New question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would this probably eat up the database server again, or does anyone think it is a viable solution for the partial matching problem?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Post Scriptum: I've unaccepted the answer from Cade Roux just to allow for further discussion and specially a possible answer to the new question.</em></p>
","<p>why not encrypt the disk holding the database tables, encrypt the database connections, and let the database operate normally?</p>

","<p>You want do use md5 hashing. Basically, it takes your string and turns it into a hash that cannot be reproduced. You can then use it to validate against things later. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$salt = ""123-=asd"";
$address = ""3412 g ave"";

$sql = ""INSERT INTO addresses (address) VALUES ('"" . md5($salt . $address) . ""')"";
mysql_query($sql);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to validate an address in the future:</p>

<pre><code>$salt = ""123-=asd"";
$address = ""3412 g ave"";

$sql = ""SELECT address FROM addresses WHERE address = '"" . md5($salt . $address) . ""'"";
$res = mysql_query($sql);
if (mysql_fetch_row($res))
    // exists
else
    // does not
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is encrypted on the database side so nobody can find it out - even if they looked in your source code. However, finding the salt will help them decrypt it though.</p>

","<p>You can do it the way you describe - effectively querying the hash, say, but there's not many systems with that requirement, because at that point the security requirements are interfering with other requirements for the system to be usable - i.e. no partial matches, since the encryption rules that out.  It's the same problem with compression.  Years ago, in a very small environment, I had to compress the data before putting it in the data format.  Of course, those fields could not easily be searched.</p>

<p>In a more typical application, ultimately, the keys are going to be available to someone in the chain - probably the web server.</p>

<p>For end user traffic SSL protects that pipe.  Some network switches can protect it between web server and database, and storing encrypted data in the database is fine, but you're not going to query on encrypted data like that.</p>

<p>And once the data is displayed, it's out there on the machine, so any general purpose computing device can be circumvented at that point, and you have perimeter defenses outside of your application which really come into play.</p>

1212,542760,0,2,sql,I have StartDate and EndDate for each record. Should I give NULL a special meaning when used in these 2 fields?,"<p>So, I have a table where StartDate and EndDate's are used to determine the activeness of a record. I thought of using NULLs to relieve the maintainers from having to manufacture some crazy dates for some of the records. For example, if NULL had defined as positive infinite when used in EndDate, the data maintainers wouldn't need to come up with something like 1-1-2100 for long-lived records. </p>

<p>I can speculate some of the trade offs on my own: defining NULL as infinities means cleaner data and elimination of periodic maintenance work, but it also means longer queries and stored procedures. So I was wondering how you guys in the real world weigh in on this. </p>

<p>EDIT: the opinions are about half-half. If I had clarified that the StartDate and EndDate are used solely for the purpose of determining the activeness of a record in the where clause, and never appears in the select list, would that tilt the scale?

","<p>I would say your own speculations are quite correct.  It's really one of those trade-off type situations.</p>

<p>My own person preference is to disallow NULL's in Date-type fields, and always use a ""high value"" for something like an end date.  For me, this greatly simplifies all queries I'll have to do against a start/end date and prevents me from having lots and lots of NULL checking in multiple queries.</p>

<p>That said, it depends upon the application.  If I must have NULL's in date fields, I'll use them, but if I can get away with substituting a real date, I will.  Of course, the downside of using a real date is that it is just that, a <em>real</em> date, and ceases to have the standard database definition of a NULL, i.e. an <em>absence</em> of data.</p>

","<p>I would tend to use defined Min and Max dates instead of nulls. Primarily because, at least in C#, when you get the data out of the DB then you have to start dealing with Nullable types, and I find that annoying. </p>

<p>It also tends to make it easier on queries. If I query with an end date of Max, then I get all dates with a max end date, plus all dates with an end date less than max, which is usually what I want. If I have nulls, then I have to do a join to get dates that are less than max and null values. Hope that makes sense. </p>

<p>I guess, bottom line, I approach these problems from a usability standpoint for developers, not db users, so that's where my perspective lies. </p>

","<p>It is probably easier if you have a sequence number as well as the time-stamp: in most RDBMSs you can create an auto-increment column and not change any of the <code>INSERT</code> statements. Then you join the table with a copy of itself to get the deltas</p>

<pre><code>select after.moment - before.moment, before.state, after.state
from object_states before, object_states after
where after.sequence + 1 = before.sequence
</code></pre>

","<p>I think that your steps (each record of your trip can be seen as a step) can be somewhere grouped together as part of the same activity. It is then possible to group your data on it, as, for example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Min(Tbl_Step.dateTimeStep) as tripBegin, _   
       Max(Tbl_Step.dateTimeStep) as tripEnd _
FROM 
       Tbl_Step 
WHERE 
       id_Activity = 'AAAAAAA'
</code></pre>

<p>Using this principle, you can then calculate other aggregates like the number of steps in the activity and so on. But you will not find an SQL way to calculate values like gap between 2 steps, as such a data does not belong either to the first or to the second step. Some reporting tools use what they call ""running sums"" to calculate such intermediate data. Depending on your objectives, this might be a solution for you.</p>

191,83050,0,2,sql,Trip time calculation in relational databases?,"<p>I had this question in mind and since I just discovered this site I decided to post it here.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a table with a timestamp and a state for a given ""object"" (generic meaning, not OOP object); is there an optimal way to calculate the time between a state and the next occurrence of another (or same) state (what I call a ""trip"") with a single SQL statement (inner SELECTs and UNIONs aren't counted)?</p>

<p>Ex: For the following, the trip time between Initial and Done would be 6 days, but between Initial and Review it would be 2 days.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2008-08-01 13:30:00 - Initial<br />
  2008-08-02 13:30:00 - Work<br />
  2008-08-03 13:30:00 - Review<br />
  2008-08-04 13:30:00 - Work<br />
  2008-08-05 13:30:00 - Review<br />
  2008-08-06 13:30:00 - Accepted<br />
  2008-08-07 13:30:00 - Done</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need to be generic, just say what <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980813/what-is-sgbd"">SGBD</a> your solution is specific to if not generic.</p>
","<p>I tried to do this in MySQL. You would need to use a variable since there is no rank function in MySQL, so it would go like this:</p>

<pre><code>set @trip1 = 0; set @trip2 = 0;
SELECT trip1.`date` as startdate, datediff(trip2.`date`, trip1.`date`) length_of_trip
FROM
(SELECT @trip1 := @trip1 + 1 as rank1, `date` from trip where state='Initial') as trip1
INNER JOIN
(SELECT @trip2 := @trip2 + 1 as rank2, `date` from trip where state='Done') as trip2
ON rank1 = rank2;
</code></pre>

<p>I am assuming that you want to calculate the time between 'Initial' and 'Done' states.</p>

<pre><code>+---------------------+----------------+
| startdate           | length_of_trip |
+---------------------+----------------+
| 2008-08-01 13:30:00 |              6 |

","<p>For complex queries with multiple optional sections, you may find that it is better to create the SQL to suit. You can do this either at the caller (for example, in C#), or in the database (at least, with SQL Server) - but either way, you <em>must</em> ensure it remains parameterised. With the caller doing the work, it is just a case of adding suitable parameters to the command. If the db is generating the TSQL, then the approach depends on the RDBMS. With SQL-Server, <code>sp_ExecuteSql</code> is your friend - i.e. you might build a <code>@cmd</code> variable based on the query, then:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC sp_ExecuteSQL @cmd, N'@someArg int', @actualArg
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>@someArg</code> is the declaration inside <code>@cmd</code>, and <code>@actualArg</code> is the value to pass in at execution time.</p>

","<p>The code looks correct to me. I think you'd definitely want to step through a debugger to see how many rows are returned from ExecuteReader. One comment I have is that the ""if (dr.HasRows)"" is kinda redundant since the ""while (dr.Read())"" will give you the same effect.</p>

<p>Another question I would have is do you know if you are missing the first or last record?</p>

<p>So I was about to start reverse engineering what Access does when it aggregates datetime using Avg, but thought I would throw the question out here first.</p>
","<p>I'm more familiar with non-MS DBMS, but... Since you cannot add two DATETIME values, you cannot ordinarily average them.  However, you could do something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT AVG(datetime_column - TIMESTAMP '2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000') +
              TIMESTAMP '2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000'
    FROM table_containing_datetime_column;
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates the average interval between the start of 2000 and the actual datetime values, and then adds that interval to the start of 2000.  The choice of 'start of 2000' is arbitrary; as long as the datetime subtracted in the AVG() function is added back, you get a sensible answer.</p>

<p>This does assume that the DBMS used supports SQL standard 'timestamp' notation, and supports the INTERVAL types appropriately.  The difference between two DATETIME or TIMESTAMP values should be an INTERVAL (indeed, INTERVAL DAY(9) TO SECOND(6), to be moderately accurate, though the '9' is somewhat debatable).</p>

<p>When appropriately mangled for the DBMS I work with, the expression 'works':</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TEMP TABLE table_containing_datetime_column
(
    datetime_column DATETIME YEAR TO FRACTION(5) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO table_containing_datetime_column VALUES('2008-11-19 12:12:12.00000');
INSERT INTO table_containing_datetime_column VALUES('2008-11-19 22:22:22.00000');

<p>In this i am trying to introduce a new column to the table and the value to it should be the value of the 3rd cloumn minus the value of 3rd column of the previous working day. Please help me in writing such a query. I am finding it difficult as the dates are not present for the week ends.</p>
","<p>You need to break this down into 2 parts. First is updating your existing data, and second is ensuring all new data has the correct value added.</p>

<p>For the first part, consider using a CURSOR. It will probably take a while to run, but at least you only run it once. Use a CURSOR like a FOR loop; iterate through each row in your data, ignoring the first row (since you haven't specified how to calculate the value for the new column when there is no previous date). Most likely you should sort by date ascending, just in case. </p>

<p>As you iterate through, use variables to store the values from this row. As you loop, copy those variables into previous row versions before you get the new row. For example, you have a variable called 'Col3' and another one called 'lastCol3'. Before you loop to the next row (ie the cursor moves to the next row) you copy the value of col3 into lastCol3 and then you get the new value for col3. Now you have your current and previous value on a per row basis, and can call 'update' to update the new column.</p>

<p>For new data going forward, you need to ensure the new value is provided, or if you want SQL Server to do it, use a stored procedure which selects the most recent row, col3, and uses the value to calculate the new value before inserting into the table.</p>

At any time, I want the end user to synchronize his/her local data to a central MySQL database.</p>

<p>Any tips, advice for getting this right?
Performance and stability is the key (besides security ;))</p>
","<p>I can think of a couple of ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Periodically, Dump your MySQL database and create a new SQLite database from the dump. You can then serve the SQLite database (SQLite databases are contained in a single file) for your users client to download and replace the current database.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a diff script that generates the necessary statements to bring the current database up to speed (various INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements). To do this, you must record the time of each change continuously in your database (the time of creation and update for each row, and keep a history of deleted rows).
User's client will download the diff file (a text file of the various statements) and apply it on the local database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both approaches have their own pros and cons - by dumping the entire database, you make sure all the data gets through. It is also much easier than creating the diff, however it might put more load on the server, depending on how often does the database gets updated between dumps. </p>

<p>On the other hand, diffing between the database will give you just the data that changed (hopefully), but it is more open to logical errors. It will incur an additional overhead on the client as well, since it will have to create/update all the necessary records instead of just copying a file.</p>

<p>Each Product is linked to an ISP, each Connection is listed to a Product. Each product can have a number of add-ons, through the use of the pivot table (which simply has 2 fields, one for the product ID and one for the AddOn ID).</p>

<p>The result I am interested in is each connection with the addons listed (I am making use of MySQL's GROUP_CONCAT for this, to make a comma-separated list of the addon's <em>name</em> field). This works fine as is, the query looks something like this:</p>

<p>Note, I changed the Denied example to be values of 2 and 7, rather than 2 and 5, based on your sample data.</p>

<p>Edit: You could also use <em>exists</em> and <em>not exists</em>, as Joe suggests.</p>

<p>Edit: The method using max(case ...), often also seen as sum(case ...) for counting values, does perform better in some cases (depends mostly on your volume of data whether the performance increase is noticeable - sometimes it can be a big difference).  I personally find the subqueries more readable, so I start with them, and if better performance is needed, I would benchmark both methods, and if max(case ...) works better, I would switch.</p>

","<p>Just to clarify why your original SQL doesn't work;</p>

<p>You need to concatenate the % wildcard to the parameter value, but what you have written is creating a literal string that contains the wildcard and the name of the parameter e.g.</p>

<p><code>Work_Phone Like '%@WorkPhone'</code></p>

<p>should be written as</p>

<p><code>Work_Phone Like '%' + @WorkPhone</code></p>

<p>The SQL you have should work if you are returning an empty string for parameters that don't have a value entered (i.e. you are returning """", and not NULL) - the Like comparison for those fields will then only contain the % wildcard (i.e. match any value). However, this is not very efficient as ideally you only want to do a comparison on the fields that the user has entered a value. This would probably require some dynamically generated SQL , as shown in the article linked to by kenj. </p>

","<p>The problem with your DECODE statement that is generating the 800 error is simple. <code>'01/01/2009'</code> is being treated as a string, and it's actually the 4th argument that generates the error.</p>

<p>Appreciate that the input and output of a DECODE statement can be different data-types, so the engine requires you to be more explicit in this case. (Do you want <code>purge_date</code> cast as a string or the string <code>'01/01/2009'</code>, or the string argument parsed as a date or the original date? There's no way for the engine to know.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DECODE(purge_date, NULL, '01/01/2009'::DATE, purge_date)
</code></pre>

<p>You could also write that 3rd argument as:</p>

<pre><code>    DATE('01/01/2009')
    MDY(1,1,2009)

@Micth Wheat - How would I refactor the following solution using the EXIST/NOT EXIST t-sql keyword?</p>
","<p>From what I read Chris Teixeira and hova use basically the same logic, but;<br />
- Hova parses the tables only once<br />
- Chris Teixeira parses the tables multiple times<br />
=>Hova's technique is preferred (in my opinion)  </p>

<p>However, Hova did it very slightly wrong...</p>

<p>The logic should be:</p>

<pre><code>- If Any 2 or 7 records   =&gt; DENIED
- ElseIf Any NULL records =&gt; PENDING
- Else                    =&gt; ACCEPTED
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the following code...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    [main].id,
    CASE WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN [status].value IN (2,7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1 THEN 'DENIED'
         WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN [status].value IS NULL  THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1 THEN 'PENDING'
         ELSE 'ACCEPTED' END
FROM
    [main]
INNER JOIN
    [status]
        ON [main].id = [status].main_id
GROUP BY
    [main].id
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the use of MAX rather than SUM (which Hova used) means that the query engine only has to find one match, not several.  Also, it is easier for an optimiser to use appropriate indexes on the [status] table.  (In the case, the index would be (main_id, value) in that order on the [status] table.</p>

<p>Dems.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Something similar could be as follows.  I have no SQL Instance to test on here, so i can't tell you if it's faster, but I image it could be...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    [main].id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN [status].value IN (2,7) THEN -1        -- Denied
             WHEN [status].value IS NULL  THEN  0        -- Pending
             ELSE                               1  END)  -- Accepted
FROM
    [main]
INNER JOIN
    [status]
        ON [main].id = [status].main_id
GROUP BY
    [main].id
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another option is just to join on a mapping table instead of using the CASE statements.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @map TABLE (
   status_value   INT,
   status_result  INT
   )

INSERT INTO @map VALUES (1,    1)

1102,504110,1,1,sql,SQL 2005 Transactional Replication: Behavior during snapshot processing?,"<p>So, I've got SQL (2005) Transactional Replication generally working well with a single publisher and single (read-only) subscriber.  Data changes and updates flow perfectly, with about 5 second latency, which is just fine.  </p>

<p>My one nagging problem, that I've spent a couple days trying to solve (and Googling everywhere for answers) is that <em>new</em> sprocs/tables/etc. do not get propagated to the read-only subscriber, even though I've added them as ""articles"" to the ""publication"".  The publication has ""transmit schema changes"" set to ON, and stored procedures are set to transfer their definitions.  But, for some reason, they don't.</p>

<p>My ""snapshot agent"" process is set to NOT SCHEDULED.  (In other words, it only happens once, when I initiate it manually.)  Should I be putting this on a schedule to enable the transfer of new or modified tables and sprocs?  </p>

<p>I thought the mere act of adding the object as an article to the publication would do it, but it's still not sending it unless I do a snapshot.  The WAN connecting these is totally fast and reliable, so that's not the issue, and table-data-updates transfer relatively fast and flawlessly.</p>

<p>While I could put my snapshot agent on a schedule, does this have any real-time production impacts for users of the main publication database or the read-only copy?  (My site currently gets 4+ million unique-users a month, so I'd like to have minimal disruption...)  Thanks!</p>
","<p>Transactional replication only distributes (and then subsequently publishes) the DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements from the transaction log of the source (publication) database.</p>

<p>New tables and stored procedures are not replicated to the subscriber. Schema changes in this particular context, although I have to admit it is a little unclear in some of the Books Online documentation, refer to the existing schema, i.e. if you were to a add column to an existing database this change would be propagated to the subscribers.</p>

<p>For clarification here is a Microsoft article that details the schema changes that you can make.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Replication is a big subject area so please let me know if I can be of further assistance.</p>

<p>Oh yes, you are correct, if you add new articles to your publication you will need to create an updated snapshot.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

1096,503680,3,1,sql,MS SQL 2005 compare field containing square parenthesis,"<p>I am using MS SQL Server 2005 (9.0.4035) and trying to find rows that contain the same data in a nvarchar(4000) field.  The field contains xml that has both opening and closing square parentheses.<br><br>
Here is sample data:<br>
    DataID   Data<br>
    1        1<br>
    2        1<br>

    6        3[<br></p>

<p>Using the 'like' operator I expected to get 3 matching pairs, but my problem is that row 5 and 6 do not match each other, I only get back that rows 1 &amp; 2 match, and 3 &amp; 4 match.</p>

<p>I know MS SQL 2005 added regular expression support in queries but I did not expect them to evaluate field data as a regular expression, which I think it is doing.  Is there a mode that I need to enable to get the proper results?</p>

<p>Any help appreciated,<br>
Ryan</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Added sql statement used:<br></p>

<p>Select t1.DataID, t2.DataID From TestTable t1, TestTable t2<br>
Where t1.DataID &lt;> t2.DataID<br>
and t1.Data like t2.Data</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Answer<br>
Using '=' operator works, but escaping the '[' does not.</p>
","<p>Change your query to use = instead of LIKE and you'll get the results that you expect.  SQL 2005 T-SQL won't do regex - you'd need to use CLR functions for that - but the LIKE statment does do pattern matching.  '[' and ']' are reserved for the pattern matching in a like statment, and you'd have to escape them out if you intended for them to be equality matches.  </p>

","<p>Use any generator you like, make sure it can start at an offset (when you use a sequence, you can initialize it accordingly).</p>

<p>For all other entities, call setId() before you insert them. Hibernate will only generate an id if the id property is 0. Note that you should first insert objects with ids into the db and then work with them. There is a lot of code in Hibernate which expects the object to be in the DB when id != 0.</p>

<p>Another solution is to use negative ids for entities which come with an id. This will also make sure that there are no collisions when you insert an new object.</p>

","<p>This is a pretty standard SQL pattern. Sometimes it's easy to inadvisedly transfer OOP/Procedural code principles like DRY to SQL, but they aren't necessarily transferable concepts. </p>

<p>Note how easily you can grok the entire logical design of the query, vs. hunting through submodules. If one of the subexpressions had an extra column, or columns reversed, it would stick out. This is basically a pretty simple SQL statement to grok as an execution unit, where disaggregating it would muddle it.</p>

<p>And when you're debugging, it's handy to be able to use the editor's text highlighting option to selectively exercise parts of the statement - a technique that doesn't exist in procedural code. OTOH, it can get messy trying to trace down all the pieces if they are scattered into views etc. Even CTEs can make this inconvenient.</p>

<p>Sometimes (sometimes) it just helps to avoid extra coding in the presentation layer.</p>

<p>As a rule, if both database and presentation are developed by one person, it doesn't matter. Problems begin when the work becames shared. In this case you, obviously, need a well stated contract on what the database emits and what ASP accepts.</p>

<p>Sure, CSS belongs to presentation layer's domain and it should be parsed by ASP rather than hardcoded in SQL.</p>

","<p>One performance tip that I see off the bat is using <code>UNION ALL</code> instead of <code>UNION</code> unless you intentionally want distinct records. A simple <code>UNION</code> will eliminate duplicates which takes time. <code>UNION ALL</code> doesn't do that.</p>

<p>You could rewrite it with dynamic SQL and a loop but I think the result would be worse. If there is enough duplicate code to justify the dynamic sql approach, then I guess it could be justified.</p>

<p>Alternatively, have you considered moving the logic out of the stored procedure into something like LINQ? For many, this isn't an option so I'm just asking.</p>

<p>A final note: resist the urge to fix what's not broken just to make it look cleaner. If cleanup will aide in maintenance, verification, etc., then go for it.</p>

","<p>Like I commented on your <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/470992/how-to-count-number-of-different-items-in-sql"">question</a> the other day, you don't need to use a LEFT JOIN in this example.  Outer joins often perform slower than inner joins, so you can get some better performance by using a simple inner join.  </p>

<p>You would need to use an outer join only if you need to show all players, even those who <em>don't</em> have any registration.</p>

<p>It seems that your query is looking for players who have been on teams in more than one club this year (like your earlier question), and then outputting some details of their registration and club name.  Here's how I would solve this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.surname, p.name, p.id, r.start_date, r.end_date, c1.short_name
FROM ejl_players p
 INNER JOIN ejl_registration r1 ON (r.player_id = p.id)
 INNER JOIN ejl_teams t1 ON (r.team_id = t1.id)
 INNER JOIN ejl_clubs c1 ON (t1.club_id = c1.id)
 INNER JOIN ejl_teams t2 ON (r.team_id = t2.id)
 INNER JOIN ejl_clubs c2 ON (t2.club_id = c2.id)
WHERE r.season = 2008
GROUP BY r.player_id, r.team_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c2.id) &gt; 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This works in MySQL because MySQL is permissive about the Single-Value Rule.  That is, the columns in your GROUP BY clause don't have to be the same as the non-aggregated columns named in your select-list.  In other brands of RDBMS, this query would generate an error.</p>

<p>Using the subquery in this manner should be more efficient but isn't always. However, it does bypass the issue of having the subquery executed for every record returned in the main query. Instead the subquery is constructed as a virtual table in memory and then used for comparison with the main query.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> I should point out that you'll want to use EXPLAIN in MySQL to verify that this query is indeed performing more efficiently.</p>

","<p>Given the data you have, there probably isn't anything much faster you can do because you have to look at a LOGIN and a LOGOUT record, and ensure there is no other LOGIN (or LOGOUT?) record for the same user between the two.</p>

<p>Alternatively, find a way to ensure that a disconnect records a logout, so that the data is complete (instead of 20% complete).  However, the query probably still has to ensure that the criteria are all met, so it won't help the query all that much.</p>

<p>If you can get the data into a format where the LOGIN and corresponding LOGOUT times are both in the same record, then you can simplify the query immensely.  I'm not clear if the SessionManager does that for you.</p>

","<p>If only 20% of your users actually log out, this search will not give you a very accurate time of each session. A better way to gauge how long an average user session is would be to take the average time between actions, or avg. time per page. This, then, can multiplied by the average number of pages/actions per visit to give a more accurate time.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can determine avg. time for each page, and then get your session end time = session time to that point + avg time spent on their last page. This will give you a much more fine-grained(and accurate) measure of time spent per session.</p>

<p>Regarding the given SQL, it seems to be more complicated than you really need. This sort of statistical operation can often be better handled/more maintainable in code external to the database where you can have the full power of whichever language you choose, and not just the rather convoluted abilities of SQL for statistical calculations</p>

<p>But if you want to the sorting as you described and that is an important requirement, it would be better to model you streetName in three parts, i.e. street (e.g. ""Street""), house_number (e.g. 1, 2, 12), house_num_addition (e.g. ""A"", ""B""). Then the sort becomes trivial in SQL.</p>

","<p>The reliable way to do it (reliable in terms of ""to sort your data correctly"", not ""to solve your general problem"") is to split the data into street name and house number and sort both of them on their own.

","<p>When you use GROUP BY, the columns in the select-list must satisfy one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Column is named in the GROUP BY (e.g. <code>btv.id_user</code> in your example)</li>
<li>Column is inside an aggregate function (e.g. <code>MIN( btv.cas )</code> )</li>
<li>Column is a <em>functional dependency</em> of the column(s) you named in the GROUP BY.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the error in your query:  <code>btv.id_zavod</code> has many values for each value of <code>btv.id_user</code>.  This does not satisfy functional dependency.  There must be only one value in <code>id_zavod</code> for each value of <code>id_user</code> for it to be a functional dependency.</p>

<p>In some database brands, this query would actually give you an error. MySQL is more flexible, trusting you to name only columns in the select-list that are functional dependencies of the column(s) you named in the GROUP BY.</p>

<p>Here's a query that returns what you want, the MIN value of <code>btv.cas</code> per <code>id_user</code>, with the corresponding value of <code>btv.id_zavod</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT b1.id_user, b1.id_zavod, b1.cas
FROM btv AS b1
 JOIN btu ON (b1.id_user = btu.id_user)
 JOIN race ON (b1.id_zavod = race.id_zavod)
 LEFT OUTER JOIN btv AS b2 ON (b1.id_user = bt2.id_user AND 
   (b1.cas &gt; b2.cas OR (b1.cas = b2.cas AND b1.primarykey &gt; b2.primarykey))
WHERE race.type = '8' AND b1.id_user = '607'
 AND b2.id_user IS NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you need to do your join as before, but then join that to <code>btv</code> again, to see if there's another row with the same <code>id_user</code> value and a smaller value in <code>cas</code>.  Use an OUTER JOIN, because you're looking for the case where there is no match.  You can test for that with <code>b2.id_user IS NULL</code>, because OUTER JOIN makes all columns NULL when there is no match.</p>

<p>Data for this table is submitted every six months.  In December, we receive July-December data from each submitter, and in June we receive July-June data.

","<p>from your description, i wouldn't worry about the efficiency of the query since apparently it only needs to run twice a year!</p>

<p>there are a few ways to do this, which one is 'best' depends on the data that you have. the datediff (on max/min date values) you suggested should work, another option is to just count records for each submitted within each date range, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>select * from (
    select T.submitterId,
        (select count(*) 
        from TABLE T1
        where T1.datefield between [july] and [december]

        group by T1.submitterId) as JDCount,
        (select count(*)
        from TABLE T2
        where T2.datefield between [december] and [june]

","<p>I think you find SQL Server Full Text works just as good but you have to understand how to build the keywords. It is not the same as Lucene, especially in terms of indexing. I think you will find that SQL Server would be better , in terms of scalability and features - especially SQL 2008 now it is part of the engine.</p>

AND count(job_person.job_id)=1 AND job_person.person_id=X

<p>Where X is some person_id.  I have tried a lot of different ways; I think it is the ""COUNT"" part that is causing problems.  I am an SQL rookie, so any help would be much appreciated.</p>
","<p>I'm not following.</p>

<p>You cannot delete <code>JOB</code> rows which have <code>JOB_PERSON</code> rows (even one) because of your FK contraints.  Thus there is no way to delete <code>JOB</code> rows based on <code>PERSON</code> rows.</p>

<p><code>JOB_PERSON</code> rows have to be deleted before either a <code>JOB</code> or <code>PERSON</code> can be deleted.</p>

<p>If you want to delete all <code>JOB</code> rows with no <code>JOB_PERSON</code>, then one way is:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM JOB
WHERE JOB_ID NOT IN (
    SELECT JOB_ID
    FROM JOB_PERSON
)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to delete all <code>JOB_PERSON</code> rows for a particular person and then all orphans, do it in two steps:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM JOB_PERSON
WHERE PERSON_ID = X

DELETE FROM JOB
WHERE JOB_ID NOT IN (
    SELECT JOB_ID
    FROM JOB_PERSON
)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to delete only the orphan <code>JOB</code>s previously linked to X, you will need to hold those in a temporary table before the first delete.</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO TEMP_TABLE
SELECT JOB.JOB_ID
FROM JOB
INNER JOIN JOB_PERSON
    ON JOB_PERSON.JOB_ID = JOB.JOB_ID

I want everything to be wiped out when I delete from one side of a Many-to-Many relationship (without querying the table; this is performance critical)</p>

<p>Here are my main tables:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE PERSON
(
    PERSON_ID INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, 
    NAME VARCHAR(50)
)

CREATE TABLE JOB
(

</code></pre>

<p>Here is my join table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE JOB_PERSON
(
    PERSON_ID INTEGER, 
    JOB_ID INTEGER
)
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my constraints:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE JOB_PERSON ADD 
    CONSTRAINT FK_PERSON_JOB FOREIGN KEY(PERSON_ID) 
    REFERENCES PERSON ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE 

ALTER TABLE JOB_PERSON ADD
    CONSTRAINT FK_JOB_PERSON FOREIGN KEY(JOB_ID) 
    REFERENCES JOB ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
</code></pre>

<p>I basically want to do this:  ""delete from person where person_id=0"" and have it delete everything from PERSON, JOB_PERSON and JOB if the JOB entity will be orphaned (no longer referenced in the many to many table)</p>

<p>Is this possible without querying the database?  When I delete, it only deletes from PERSON and JOB_PERSON.  As you can probably tell, my sql skills are lacking.</p>

<p>Here is the dummy data I have been playing around with:</p>

<pre><code>insert into person values(null,'Arthur');
insert into person values(null,'James');
insert into job values(null, 'Programmer')
insert into job values(null, 'Manager')
insert into job_person values(0,0);
insert into job_person values(0,1);
insert into job_person values(1,1);
</code></pre>

<p>So if I enter both of these statements:  </p>

<pre><code>delete from person where person_id=0
delete from person where person_id=1
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to have everything in all 3 tables deleted.  Possible?</p>
","<p>Create a Store Procedure where you pass the ID, then simply DELETE the proper row in the order you need to.</p>

<p>This way your app isn't tied to the exact order, which might change in the future with DB redesigns.  You also gain the added bonus that Stored Procs are faster then sending a bunch of queries.</p>

<p>Although if you absolutely wanted a way to delete the dependent tables when you try to delete that entry, you have to use triggers, but the rule for triggers are, avoid them whenever possible, if another solution exists, use it.  So ultimately, using a Stored Proc is the best solution.</p>

731,339560,1,1,sql,T-SQL Query Optimization,"<p>I'm working on some upgrades to an internal web analytics system we provide for our clients (in the absence of a preferred vendor or Google Analytics), and I'm working on the following query:</p>

<p>I've tested this query with 2 million rows in the PageViews table and it takes about 20 seconds to run. I'm noticing a clustered index scan twice in the execution plan, both times it hits the PageViews table. There is a clustered index on the Created column in that table.</p>

<p>The problem is that in both cases it appears to iterate over all 2 million rows, which I believe is the performance bottleneck. Is there anything I can do to prevent this, or am I pretty much maxed out as far as optimization goes?</p>

<p>For reference, the purpose of the query is to find the first page view for each session.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After much frustration, despite the help received here, I could not make this query work. Therefore, I decided to simply store a reference to the entry page (and now exit page) in the sessions table, which allows me to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>select

","<p>Your inner query (pv1) will require a nonclustered index on (Domain).</p>

<p>The second query (pv2) can already find the rows it needs due to the clustered index on Created, but pv1 might be returning so many rows that SQL Server decides that a table scan is quicker than all the locks it would need to take.  As pv1 groups on SessionID (and hence has to order by SessionID), a nonclustered index on SessionID, Created, and including path should permit a MERGE join to occur.  If not, you can force a merge join with ""SELECT .. FROM pageviews pv2 INNER MERGE JOIN ...""</p>

<p>The two indexes listed above will be:</p>

<p>CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ncixcampaigndomain ON PageViews (Domain)</p>

<p>CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX ncixsessionidcreated ON PageViews(SessionID, Created) INCLUDE (path)</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the strategy of of using PMD/Findbugs/etc to create a rule that any string passed to PreparedStatement where there is an ""="" or ""in"" has only parametrized vars on the compare side.</p>

<p>Has anyone done this? Or done this by other means?</p>
","<p>This is a tricky problem.  Comparison operators like <code>=</code> and <code>IN()</code> are some cases, but there's also:  <code>!= &lt;&gt; &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= LIKE</code>.</p>

<p>How do you spot cases of interpolating application variables as literals in expressions?</p>

<pre><code>String sql = ""SELECT *, "" + someJavaVar + "" AS constant_column FROM mytable"";
</code></pre>

<p>You could search for SQL containing string delimiters, but SQL injection doesn't come only from interpolating string literals.</p>

<p>How would you spot cases of interpolating application variables as things other than data values?</p>

<pre><code>String sql = ""SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY "" + columnname;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know any automatic way to detect SQL injection flaws.  Code review is a more effective way to spot them.  In every SQL statement that contains interpolated application variables, you have to confirm that the application variables are ""safe"" and that your app has explicitly validated them or transformed them so they don't contain dangerous payload.</p>

","<p>The best way to do this is using Oracle Regular Expressions feature, like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT LOWER(regexp_replace('Smith, John R',

             '\3\1', 1, 1))

<p>That says, 1) when you find the pattern of any set of characters, followed by "", "", followed by an uppercase character, followed by any remaining characters, take the third element (initial of first name) and append the last name.  Then make everything lowercase.</p>

<p>Your side note: ""instr() function is not compatible with my version"" doesn't make sense to me, as that function's been around for ages.  Check your version, because Regular Expressions was only added to Oracle in version 9i.</p>

662,289220,2,1,sql,Updating an associative table in MySQL,"<p>Below is my (simplified) schema (in MySQL ver. 5.0.51b) and my strategy for updating it. There has got to be a better way. Inserting a new item requires 4 trips to the database and editing/updating an item takes up to <strong>7</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>items</strong>: itemId, itemName
<br /><strong>categories</strong>: catId, catName
<br /><strong>map</strong>: mapId*, itemId, catId
<br />* mapId (varchar) is concat of itemId + | + catId</p>

<p>1) If inserting: insert item. Get itemId via MySQL API.
<br />Else updating: just update the item table. We already have the itemId.</p>

<p>2) Conditionally batch insert into <code>categories</code>.</p>

<pre><code>INSERT IGNORE INTO categories (catName)
VALUES ('each'), ('category'), ('name');
</code></pre>

<p>3) Select IDs from <code>categories</code>.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT catId FROM categories
WHERE catName = 'each' OR catName = 'category' OR catName = 'name';
</code></pre>

<p>4) Conditionally batch insert into <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre><code>INSERT IGNORE INTO map (mapId, itemId, catId)
VALUES ('1|1', 1, 1), ('1|2', 1, 2), ('1|3', 1, 3);
</code></pre>

<p>If inserting: we're done. Else updating: continue.</p>

<p>5) It's possible that we no longer associate a category with this item that we did prior to the update. Delete old categories for this itemId.</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM MAP WHERE itemId = 2
AND catID &lt;&gt; 2 AND catID &lt;&gt; 3 AND catID &lt;&gt; 5;
</code></pre>

<p>6) If we have disassociated ourselves from a category, it's possible that we left it orphaned. We do not want categories with no items. Therefore, if <code>affected rows &gt; 0</code>, kill orphaned categories. I haven't found a way to combine these in MySQL, so this is #6 &amp; #7.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT categories.catId
FROM categories
LEFT JOIN map USING (catId)
GROUP BY categories.catId
HAVING COUNT(map.catId) &lt; 1;
</code></pre>

<p>7) Delete IDs found in step 6.</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM categories
WHERE catId = 9
  AND catId = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Please tell me there's a better way that I'm not seeing.</p>
","<p>Also, if you are worried about trips to the db, make steps into a stored procedure.  Then you have one trip.</p>

96,35320,2,1,sql,How do you get the last record generated in a recursive CTE?,"<p>In the code below I am using a recursive CTE(Common Table Expression) in SQL Server 2005 to try and find the top level parent of a basic hierarchical structure. The rule of this hierarchy is that every CustID has a ParentID and if the CustID has no parent then the ParentID = CustID and it is the highest level.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1

WITH cteLevelOne (ParentID, CustID) AS
(
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	WHERE    a.CustID = @LookupID
    UNION ALL
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	INNER JOIN cteLevelOne AS c ON a.CustID = c.ParentID
    	WHERE c.CustID &lt;&gt; a.CustomerID
)
</code></pre>

<p>So if tblCustomer looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5
1            8
5            4
4            1
</code></pre>

<p>The result I get from the code above is:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
4            1
5            4
5            5
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is just the last row of that result:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5
</code></pre>

<p>How do I just return the last record generated in the CTE (which would be highest level CustID)?</p>

<p>Also note that there are multiple unrelated CustID hierarchies in this table so I can't just do a SELECT * FROM tblCustomer WHERE ParentID = CustID. I can't order by ParentID or CustID because the ID number is not related to where it is in the hierarchy.</p>
","<p>If you just want want the highest recursion depth couldn't you do something like this?Then, when you actually query the CTE just look for the row with max(Depth)?  Like so:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1;

WITH cteLevelOne (ParentID, CustID, Depth) AS
(
        SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID, 1
        FROM     tblCustomer AS a
        WHERE    a.CustID = @LookupID
    UNION ALL
        SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID, c.Depth + 1
        FROM     tblCustomer AS a
        INNER JOIN cteLevelOne AS c ON a.CustID = c.ParentID 
        WHERE c.CustID &lt;&gt; a.CustID
)
select * from CTELevelone where Depth = (select max(Depth) from CTELevelone)
</code></pre>

<p>or, adapting what trevor suggests, this could be used with the same CTE:  </p>

<pre><code>select top 1 * from CTELevelone order by Depth desc
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think CustomerID was necessarily what you wanted to order by in the case you described, but I wasn't perfectly clear on the question either.</p>

254,116630,1,1,sql,Hiding Subreports in SQL Report (RDL),"<p>I have a bunch a reports that are printed out and mailed to clients. At the top of the report is the return address, left aligned. I was asked to add an optional logo to the report. This logo should be left of the return address. (The logo and all other info is stored in the database). So if the logo exists, you SHOULD see:</p>

<p>&lt;someimage&gt; &lt;Return Address&gt;</p>

<p>And if no logo exists, you SHOULD see:</p>

<p>&lt;Return Address&gt;</p>

<p>There are many different logos possible placed in many different reports, so to make life easier, the logo was implemented as a subreport. The subreport just grabs the correct logo image, and then it automatically displays in the report.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is this. If the log DOES NOT exist, then we want the return address left aligned, as shown above. But what is happening is that while the subreport shows nothing, it still takes up the space where the logo WOULD be, and the return address is floating a few inches to the right of the left side of the page.</p>

<pre><code>           &lt;Return Address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>SO... is there a setting I can use/set to get the subreport to either not show, or not take up any space, if there is no logo to be displayed?</p>

<p>Sorry, hope I made this clear enough. I'm totally new to RDL's.</p>
","<p>You should be able to set an expression on the subreport's visibility so that it does not show if there isn't a logo.</p>

<p>Here is the XML from an RDL I had handy:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Subreport Name=""SubReport""&gt;
  &lt;ReportName&gt;SubReport&lt;/ReportName&gt;
  &lt;Visibility&gt;
    &lt;Hidden&gt;=Not Parameters!ShowLogo.Value&lt;/Hidden&gt;
  &lt;/Visibility&gt;
&lt;/Subreport&gt;
</code></pre>

95,35320,1,1,sql,How do you get the last record generated in a recursive CTE?,"<p>In the code below I am using a recursive CTE(Common Table Expression) in SQL Server 2005 to try and find the top level parent of a basic hierarchical structure. The rule of this hierarchy is that every CustID has a ParentID and if the CustID has no parent then the ParentID = CustID and it is the highest level.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1

WITH cteLevelOne (ParentID, CustID) AS
(
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	WHERE    a.CustID = @LookupID
    UNION ALL
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	INNER JOIN cteLevelOne AS c ON a.CustID = c.ParentID
    	WHERE c.CustID &lt;&gt; a.CustomerID
)

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5

<p>How do I just return the last record generated in the CTE (which would be highest level CustID)?</p>

<p>Also note that there are multiple unrelated CustID hierarchies in this table so I can't just do a SELECT * FROM tblCustomer WHERE ParentID = CustID. I can't order by ParentID or CustID because the ID number is not related to where it is in the hierarchy.</p>

","<p>I have two suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Perhaps you need to consolidate all your tables. If they all contain the same structure, then why not have one ""master"" module table, that just adds one new column identifying the module (""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ....)</p>

<p>If your module tables are mostly the same, but you have a few columns that are different, you might still be able to consolidate all the common information into one table, and keep smaller module-specific tables with those differences. Then you would just need to do a join on them.</p>

<p>This suggestion assumes that your query on the column section_id you mention is super-critical to look up quickly. With one query you get all the common information, and with a second you would get any specific information if you needed it. (And you might not -- for instance if you were trying to validate the existense of the section, then finding it in the common table would be enough)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively you can add another table that maps section_id's to the modules that they are in.</p>

<pre>
section_id | module
-----------+-------
      1    |  A
      2    |  B
      3    |  A
     ...   | ...
</pre>

<p>This does mean though that you have to run two queries, one against this mapping table, and another against the module table to pull out any useful data.</p>

<p>You can extend this table with other columns and indices on those columns if you need to look up other columns that are common to all modules.</p>

<p>This method has the definite disadvanage that the data is duplicated.</p></li>

I'm trying to do this in SQL (using PostgreSQL) and I have a proposed structure for recording user changes like the following.</p>

  userid SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
  name VARCHAR(40), 
  status CHAR NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE status_log (
  logid SERIAL, 
  userid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(userid), 
  status CHAR NOT NULL, 
  logcreated TIMESTAMP
);
</code></pre>

<p>That's my proposed table structure, based on the data.</p>

<p>For the status field 'a' represents an active user and 's' represents a suspended user,</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO status_log (userid, status, logcreated) VALUES (1, 's', '2008-01-01'); 
INSERT INTO status_log (userid, status, logcreated) VALUES (1, 'a', '2008-02-01');

<p>1) Is this the best way to structure this data for this kind of query?</p>

<p>2) How do I query the data in either this structure or in your proposed modified structure so that I can simply have a date (say 15th January) and find a list of customers that had an active status on that date in SQL only? Is this a job for SQL?</p>
","<p>@Tony the ""end"" date isn't necessarily applicable.</p>

948,439670,0,1,sql,How can I mix COUNT() and non-COUNT() columns without losing information in the query?,"<p>I started with a query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT strip.name as strip, character.name as character
  from strips, characters, appearances
 where strips.id = appearances.strip_id
   and characters.id = appearances.character.id
   and appearances.date in (...)
</code></pre>

<p>Which yielded me some results:</p>

<pre><code>strip                 | character
'Calvin &amp; Hobbes'     | 'Calvin'
'Calvin &amp; Hobbes'     | 'Hobbes'
'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Pig'
'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Rat'
'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Hobbes'  # a guest appearance
'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Calvin'  # a guest appearance
</code></pre>

<p>Then I wanted to also get the <code>COUNT</code> of the number of times a character is used (in any strip) within the result set.  So I tried:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(character.id), strip.name as strip, character.name as character
  from strips, characters, appearances
 where strips.id = appearances.strip_id
   and characters.id = appearances.character.id
   and appearances.date in (...)
</code></pre>

<p>But that gave me</p>

<pre><code>[ERROR 11:20:17] Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT(),...) with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
</code></pre>

<p>So I tried:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(character.id), strip.name as strip, character.name as character
  from strips, characters, appearances
 where strips.id = appearances.strip_id
   and characters.id = appearances.character.id
   and appearances.date in (...)
 group by character.id
</code></pre>

<p>Which gave me</p>

<pre><code>count | strip                 | character
4     | 'Calvin &amp; Hobbes'     | 'Calvin'
4     | 'Calvin &amp; Hobbes'     | 'Hobbes'
2     | 'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Pig'
2     | 'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Rat'
</code></pre>

<p>That is, I lose all the extra information about exactly which characters appear in which strips.</p>

<p>What I'd like to get is this:</p>

<pre><code>count | strip                 | character

2     | 'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Rat'
4     | 'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Calvin'
4     | 'Pearls Before Swine' | 'Hobbes'

","<p>As Aaron mentioned, you should get a hold of the query text that is going to be run against the database and use an EXPLAIN (or other some method) to view the query execution plan. Once you have a hold of the execution plan for the query you can see what is going on in the database itself. There are a lot of operations that see very expensive to run through procedural code that are very trivial for any database to run, especially if you provide indexes that the database can use for speeding up your query.</p>

<p>If I read your question correctly, you're retrieving a result set of all rows in the Soknad table. Once you have these results back you use the filter() method to trim down your results meet your criteria. From looking at the Django documentation, it looks like this will do an in-memory filter rather than re-query the database (of course, this really depends on which data access layer you're using and not on Django itself).</p>

<p>The most optimal solution would be to use a full-text search engine (Lucene, ferret, etc) to handle this for you. If that is not available or practical the next best option would be to to construct a query predicate (WHERE clause) before issuing your query to the database and let the database perform the filtering. </p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> as with all things that involve the database, the real answer is 'it depends.' The best suggestion is to try out several different approaches using data that is close to production and benchmark them over at least 3 iterations before settling on a final solution to the problem. It may be just as fast, or even faster, to filter in memory rather than filter in the database.</p>

","<p>You might want to switch to use extension methods.  It may make it a little easier to chain these together.  Also, you won't be able to do less-than/greater-than comparisons on strings since SQL doesn't support these types of string comparisons.  If you stored ids that had the same ordering as the string descriptions, however, you could compare these.</p>

<p>Using extension methods you can do things like:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt;  attributeMap = new Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt;();
attributeMap.Add(""MEMORY"",1000);
attributeMap.Add(""SPEED"",2800);

var results = db.ComputerAttributes;

}

var ids = results.Select( c =&gt; c.ComputerID );

foreach (int id in ids)
{
    ...
}

401,182130,0,1,sql,SQL - state machine - reporting on historical data based on changeset,"<p>I want to record user states and then be able to report historically based on the record of changes we've kept. I'm trying to do this in SQL (using PostgreSQL) and I have a proposed structure for recording user changes like the following.</p>

<p>That's my proposed table structure, based on the data.</p>

<p>For the status field 'a' represents an active user and 's' represents a suspended user,</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO status_log (userid, status, logcreated) VALUES (1, 's', '2008-01-01');

<p>So this user was suspended on 1st Jan and active again on 1st of February.</p>

<p>1) Is this the best way to structure this data for this kind of query?</p>

<p>2) How do I query the data in either this structure or in your proposed modified structure so that I can simply have a date (say 15th January) and find a list of customers that had an active status on that date in SQL only? Is this a job for SQL?</p>
","<p>@Phil</p>

<p>I like Tony's solution. It seems to most approriately model the situation described. Any particular user has a status for a given period of time (a minute, an hour, a day, etc.), but it is for a duration, not an instant in time. Since you want to know who was active during a certain period of time, modeling the information as a duration seems like the best approach.</p>

<p>I am not sure that additional statuses are a problem. If someone is active, then suspended, then cancelled, then active again, each of those statuses would be applicable for a given duration, would they not? It may be a vey short duration, such as a few seconds or a minute, but they would still be for a length of time.</p>

<p>Are you concerned that a person's status can change multiple times in a given day, but you want to know who was active for a given day? If so, then you just need to more specifically define what it means to be active on a given day. If it is enough that they were active for any part of that day, then Tony's answer works well as is. If they would have to be active for a certain amount of time in a given day, then Tony's solution could be modified to simply determine the length of time (in hours, or minutes, or days), and adding further restrictions in the WHERE clause to retrieve for the proper date, status, and length of time in that status.</p>

<p>As for there being no ""end date"" for the current status, that is no problem either as long as the end date were nullable. Simply use something like this ""WHERE enddate &lt;= '2008-08-15' or enddate is null"".</p>

67,28280,2,1,sql,Can I maintain state between calls to a SQL Server UDF?,"<p>I have a SQL script that inserts data (via INSERT statements currently numbering in the thousands) One of the columns contains a unique identifier (though not an IDENTITY type, just a plain ol' int) that's actually unique across a few different tables. </p>

<p>I'd like to add a scalar function to my script that gets the next available ID (i.e. last used ID + 1) but I'm not sure this is possible because there doesn't seem to be a way to use a global or static variable from within a UDF, I can't use a temp table, and I can't update a permanent table from within a function. </p>

<p>Currently my script looks like this: </p>

<pre>
   declare @v_baseID int 
   exec dbo.getNextID @v_baseID out  --sproc to get the next available id
   --Lots of these - where n is a hardcoded value
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', @v_baseID + n ) 
   exec dbo.UpdateNextID @v_baseID + lastUsedn  --sproc to update the last used id

<pre>
   --Lots of these
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', getNextID() ) 
</pre>

<p>Hardcoding the offset is a pain in the arse, and is error prone.  Packaging it up into a simple scalar function is very appealing, but I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls.  Is that right, or is there something I'm missing.  </p>

","<p>This can be done, but would be a lot more efficient if you stored the end date of each log.  With your model you have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>select l1.userid
from status_log l1
where l1.status='s'
and l1.logcreated = (select max(l2.logcreated)
                     from status_log l2
                     where l2.userid = l1.userid
                     and   l2.logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'
                    );

<p>With the additional column it woud be more like:</p>

<pre><code>select userid
from status_log
where status='s'
and logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'
and logsuperseded &gt;= date '2008-02-15';
</code></pre>

<p>(Apologies for any syntax errors, I don't know Postgresql.)</p>

<p>To address some further issues raised by Phil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A user might get moved from active, to suspended, to cancelled, to active again. This is a simplified version, in reality, there are even more states and people can be moved directly from one state to another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would appear in the table like this:</p>

<pre><code>userid  from       to         status
FRED    2008-01-01 2008-01-31 s
FRED    2008-02-01 2008-02-07 c
FRED    2008-02-08            a
</code></pre>

<p>I used a null for the ""to"" date of the current record.  I could have used a future date like 2999-12-31 but null is preferable in some ways.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, there would be no ""end date"" for the current status either, so I think this slightly breaks your query?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, my query would have to be re-written as</p>

<pre><code>select userid
from status_log
where status='s'
and logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'
and (logsuperseded is null or logsuperseded &gt;= date '2008-02-15');

","<p>It would probably be more work than it's worth, but you can use static C#/VB variables in a SQL CLR UDF, so I think you'd be able to do what you want to do by simply incrementing this variable every time the UDF is called.  The static variable would be lost whenever the appdomain unloaded, of course.  So if you need continuity of your ID from one day to the next, you'd need a way, on first access of NextId, to poll all of tables that use this ID, to find the highest value.</p>

<p>You aren't missing anything; SQL Server does not support global variables, and it doesn't support data modification within UDFs.  And even if you wanted to do something as kludgy as using CONTEXT_INFO (see <a href=""http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/04/23/60185.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/04/23/60185.aspx</a>), you can't set that from within a UDF anyway.</p>

<p>Is there a way you can get around the ""hardcoding"" of the offset by making that a variable and looping over the iteration of it, doing the inserts within that loop?</p>

265,121700,2,1,sql,What Exception should be thrown when an ADO.NET query cannot retrieve the requested data?,"<p>In an attempt to add some parameter validation and correct usage semantics to our application, we are trying to add correct exception handling to our .NET applications.</p>

<p>My question is this: When throwing exceptions in ADO.NET if a particular query returns no data or the data could not be found, what type of exception should I use?</p>

<p>Psuedocode:
(read, don't scrutinize the semantics of the code, I know it won't compile)</p>

<pre><code>public DataSet GetData(int identifier)
{
    dataAdapter.Command.Text = ""Select * from table1 Where ident = "" + identifier.toString();
    DataSet ds = dataAdapter.Fill(ds);
    if (ds.table1.Rows.Count == 0)
        throw new Exception(""Data not found"");

    return ds;
}
</code></pre>
","<p>You really should define your own exception : DataNotFoundException.</p>

<p>You should not use the basic class Exception, since when you will catch it in calling code, you will write something like</p>

<pre><code>try
{
     int i;
     GetData(i);

}
catch(Exception e) //will catch many many exceptions
{
    //Handle gracefully the ""Data not Found"" case;
    //Whatever else happens will get caught and ignored
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where as catching only your DataNotFoundEXception will get only the case you really want to handle.</p>

<pre><code>try
{
     int i;
     GetData(i);

}
catch(DataNotFoundException e) 
{
    //Handle gracefully the ""Data not Found"" case;
} //Any other exception will bubble up
</code></pre>

","<p>If the tables are changing over time, you can inline code gen your solution in an SP (pseudo code - you'll have to fill in):</p>

1134,523710,1,0,sql,Union or Use Flow Control Logic to Determine which table to report on,"<p>I'm working with a 3rd pary app where I can't alter the tables. We built custom matching ""Monthly"" tables with an additional datetime column ""AsOfDate"" where we dump the data at the end of the month and flag those data with the date of last day of the month.</p>

<p>I want to be able to create a single Stored Procedure (Application is designed to require a view or stored proc as the source of all reports.) and use a parameter which will either use the current data table (Parameter may be NULL or = Today's Date) or use the month end table and filter by the End of the month date. This way, I have one report where the user can either use current or data from a particular month end period. </p>

<p>Which would you prefer (And why) Sorry, this is not fully coded</p>

<p><strong>Solution #1 Union Query</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

Select Column1
From
    (Select GetDate() as AsOfDate
       , Column1 
     From Current.Balance
    Union 
    Select AsOfDate
       , Column1 From MonthEnd.Balance
    ) AS All_Balances
Where All_Balances.AsOfDate = @AsOfDate
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution #2 Use If Statement to select table</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

If @AsOfDate IS NULL or @AsOfDate = GetDate()
   Select GetDate() as AsOfDate
       , Column1 
     From Current.Balance
Else
    Select AsOfDate
       , Column1 From MonthEnd.Balance
    Where AsOfDate = @AsOfDate
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is not fully coded and is sort of db agnostic (But it is SQL Server 2005).</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Variation to Solution #2 using separate stored procedures</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

If @AsOfDate IS NULL or @AsOfDate = GetDate()
   Exec Current_Balance_Date -- no param necessary
Else
    exec MonthEnd_Balance_Date @AsOfDate
</code></pre>
","<p>How you have things set up, the second method will probably be faster. If you were to use a partitioned view then you could set up constraints in such a way that the optimized would know to ignore one or more of the tables in the select and you would get the same performance. This would also let you keep all of your logic in one statement rather than having to keep two statements in sync. That may or may not be an issue for you based on how complex the SELECT statement is.</p>

<p>One thing to remember though, is that if you use the second method, be sure to mark your stored procedure as WITH (RECOMPILE) (I can't remember if the parentheses are require or not - check the syntax). That way the optimizer will create a new query plan based on which branch of the IF statement needs to be executed.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `books`.`bookTagNum` , `books`.`shelfNum` , `shelf`.`shelfTagNum` , `books`.`title`
FROM books, shelf
where `books`.`shelfNum`=`books`.`shelfNum`
ORDER BY `shelf`.`shelfTagNum` ASC

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>I think you want</p>

<pre><code>where `books`.`shelfTagNum`=`shelf`.`shelfNum`
</code></pre>

<p>In order to match rows from the <code>books</code> and <code>shelf</code> tables, you need to have terms from each in your <code>where</code> clause - otherwise, you're just performing a no-operation check on the rows of <code>books</code>, since every row's <code>shelfNum</code> will be equal to its <code>shelfNum</code>.</p>

<p>As @<a href=""#267544"" rel=""nofollow"">fixme.myopenid.com</a> suggests, you could also go the explicit <code>JOIN</code> route, but it's not necessary.</p>

1133,523710,1,0,sql,Union or Use Flow Control Logic to Determine which table to report on,"<p>I'm working with a 3rd pary app where I can't alter the tables. We built custom matching ""Monthly"" tables with an additional datetime column ""AsOfDate"" where we dump the data at the end of the month and flag those data with the date of last day of the month.</p>

<p>I want to be able to create a single Stored Procedure (Application is designed to require a view or stored proc as the source of all reports.) and use a parameter which will either use the current data table (Parameter may be NULL or = Today's Date) or use the month end table and filter by the End of the month date. This way, I have one report where the user can either use current or data from a particular month end period. </p>

<p>Which would you prefer (And why) Sorry, this is not fully coded</p>

<p><strong>Solution #1 Union Query</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

Select Column1
From
    (Select GetDate() as AsOfDate
       , Column1 
     From Current.Balance
    Union 
    Select AsOfDate
       , Column1 From MonthEnd.Balance
    ) AS All_Balances
Where All_Balances.AsOfDate = @AsOfDate
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Solution #2 Use If Statement to select table</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

If @AsOfDate IS NULL or @AsOfDate = GetDate()
   Select GetDate() as AsOfDate
       , Column1 
     From Current.Balance
Else
    Select AsOfDate
       , Column1 From MonthEnd.Balance
    Where AsOfDate = @AsOfDate
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is not fully coded and is sort of db agnostic (But it is SQL Server 2005).</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Variation to Solution #2 using separate stored procedures</strong></p>

<pre><code>Create Proc Balance_Report (@AsOfDate)
AS

If @AsOfDate IS NULL or @AsOfDate = GetDate()
   Exec Current_Balance_Date -- no param necessary
Else
    exec MonthEnd_Balance_Date @AsOfDate
</code></pre>
","<p>I prefer the non-union solution.  Selecting from a single table will always be faster than doing a union and selecting a single table's data from the union.</p>

I would think this would be with constraints.
The constraint would be <em>no action</em> at first so the constraint will throw an error that can be caught by the UI. After the UI receives a confirmation, the constraint should become a <em>cascade</em>.</p>

<p>Somehow I'm feeling like I'm getting this all wrong..</p>
","<p>What I would do is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The constraint is CASCADE</li>
<li>The application checks if preferences exist.</li>
<li>If they do, show the warning.</li>
<li>If no preferences exist, or the warning is accepted, delete the client.</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing database relationships on the fly is not going to be a good idea!!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

182,81560,0,0,sql,override constraint from no action to cascading at runtime,"<p>I feel like I have a verry basic/stupid question, yet I never saw/read/heard anything in this direction.</p>

<p>Say I have a table <em>users(userId, name)</em> and a table <em>preferences(id, userId, language)</em>. The example is trivial, but could be extended to a situation with multi-level relations and way more tables..
When my UI requests to delete a user I first want to show a warning stating that also its preferences will be deleted. If at some point the database gets extended with more tables and relationships, but the software isn't adapted accordingly (client didn't update) a generic message should be shown.</p>

<p>How can I implement this? The UI cannot know about the whole data structure and should not be bothered to walk down all the relations to manually delete all the depending records.<br />
I would think this would be with constraints.
The constraint would be <em>no action</em> at first so the constraint will throw an error that can be caught by the UI. After the UI receives a confirmation, the constraint should become a <em>cascade</em>.</p>

<p>Somehow I'm feeling like I'm getting this all wrong..</p>
","<p>If you are worried about the user not realising the full impact of their delete, you might want to consider not actually deleting the data - instead you could simply set a flag on a column called say ""<code>marked_for_deletion</code>"". (the entries could then be deleted a safe time later)<br />
The downside is that you need to remember to filter out the marked rows in other queries. This can be mitigated by creating a view on the table with the marked rows filtered out, and then always using the view in your queries.</p>

There are some commercial products like <a href=""http://www.SQLManager.net"" rel=""nofollow"">EMS</a> that can more or less do the job for you. EMS has a data exporter module that can take your SQL data in different formats, including Access. </p>

END
</code></pre>

<p>So by default the Stored Proc return a scalar value and if SearchType = something valid it will return a IMultipleValues.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I drop my Stored Proc in the DataContext designer, it creates the LINQ-to-SQL for a function that only returns a scalar int. It doesn't understands that the Strored Proc could return a IMultipleResults with a scalar value and a DataSet.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to made LINQ-to-SQL to extrapolate the possible return values?</p>
","<p>I can't answer your question directly, but have you tried using SQL Profiler to work out how the designer retrieves the metadata for your stored procedure? </p>

<p>I'm thinking that in your situation it may not be possible for the designer to figure things out for you. SQL Profiler will let you figure this out for sure either way...</p>

<p>I've had quite a positive experience with using SqlMetal (instead of the designer). To save you Googling the documentation is at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386987.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386987.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>One of the ways you can use SqlMetal is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run SqlMetal to extract database metadata to a DBML file. </li>
<li>Run some custom processing on the DBML file (which is easy to do as it's just XML). </li>
<li>Run SqlMetal again to turn the updated DBML into code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using this approach, you could correct the metadata being used for your stored procedure (assuming it can't be determined correctly).</p>

<p>The winning thing about this approach for me is that you can modify your database whenever you need to, and easily regenerate the matching strongly typed code, while still retaining a high degree of control over what is generated.</p>

<li><p>Are you sure that you are using the ""same"" database connection in SQLPlus as in the code (database, user etc.)?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure that that is indeed the SQL sent to the database? (You may check by tracing on the Oracle server or by debugging the VB code). Reformatting may have changed ""something"".</p></li>

","<p>I would think about this differently.  You have different types of measures (volume, weight, count, etc.).  Each of those measures has different, convertible units.  Choosing a measure (ounces, for example), choose both a measure type and a particular unit.  I'd have a way of converting between units of the same measure type -- to support resizing recipes -- but I wouldn't worry about converting between different measure types.</p>

<p>Once you know the type, you can store all values in the database in terms of a base unit for that measure type.  Based on the value, and perhaps user preference, you can translate that to a suitable display unit when you show it.  I don't think this would be particularly easy to do in SQL and I wouldn't be afraid of doing the conversion in code.  You simply need to have a different display formatter for each measure type that chooses the appropriate unit and does the conversion.</p>

","<p>From a design standpoint it seems good to have the 3 foreign keys you listed.  It looks like the error message you are getting relates to the ON UPDATE CASCADE options on your foreign keys (although I was able to create the table as specified).  Regardless, to get the behavior you mention wanting, I would recommend a trigger on the Employees table, that fires before you delete the record.  This trigger would find instances of the Employees.OjbectID in the Vouchers table and set them to NULL.</p>

<p>Assembly language is a very low level language where you instruct the processor exactly what to do, including what registers you want to use etc. </p>

<p>SQL is a very high level language where you describe the semantics of what you want, and then a query optimiser decides how to execute it, so you don't even control what gets executed. It's an extremely powerful and flexible language of which any ORM offers at most a (fairly small) subset.</p>

<p>You'll notice that the .NET framework has introduced LINQ recently which is a way to introduce high level SQL-like constructs into languages like C# and VB. Rather than being like assembler, it's pretty easy to argue that SQL works at a higher level of abstraction than most mainstream programming languages.</p>

","<p>Strictly from a relational design point of view, the Vouchers table as three Foreign Keys. Whether you choose to enforce them, through CASCADE assertions or otherwise, is an implementation issue, but the relational design still exists. Presumably you want to enforce that, if one of the three fields is not NULL, then a matching record needs to exist. Or not. It's an implementation issue as to whether or not you care to enforce the design.</p>

<p>However, the violations you describe are assumed at your peril. The fact that you're asking this question suggests you may not fully appreciate all the ways these choices can lead into the swamp.</p>

<p>I think the error may be a consequence of the fact that more than one of the three might refer to the same employee.</p>

<p>BTW, I've in very few cases ever found it necessary to delete records in such a fashion that CASCADES are useful. Usually that would be used to prevent the database from being too big; and database capacity is less and less an issue over time.</p>

<p>The table in question returns a list of IP addresses from the database. The key column in question is <code>code_status</code>. Some time ago, we realized that one of the IP addresses was no longer valid, so we changed its status to <code>I</code> (invalid) to exclude it from appearing in the query's results.</p>

<p>When you execute the query above in SQL Plus, or in SQL Developer, everything is fine. But when you execute it from VB6, the check against <code>code_status</code> is ignored, and the invalid IP address appears in the result set.</p>

<p>This is <em>ancient</em> VB6 code. The SQL is embedded in the application. At the moment, I don't have time to rewrite it as a stored procedure. (I will some day, given the chance.)

","<p>There are Oracle bugs that result in incorrect answers. This surely isn't one of those times. Usually they involve some bizarre combination of views and functions and dblinks and lunar phases...</p>

<p>It's not cached anywhere. Oracle doesn't cache results until 11 and even then it knows to change the cache when the answer may change.</p>

<p>I would guess this is a data issue. You have a DISTINCT on the IP address in the query, why? If there's no unique constraint, there may be more than one copy of your IP address and you only fixed one of them.</p>

<p>And your Code_status is in a completely different table from your IP addresses. You set the status to ""I"" in the code table and you get the list of IPs from the Location table.</p>

<p>Stop thinking zebras and start thinking horses. This is almost certainly just data you do not fully understand. </p>

   a.location_type_code,

   b.ip_address = &lt;the one you think you fixed&gt;

","<p>Since your ""having"" condition isn't actually on an aggregated column, couldn't you just use the ""where"" clause?</p>

<pre><code>select distinct CollectId, url, userid, pubtime

where pubtime &gt;= (select max(pubtime) from collect d where d.url = collect.url)
order by Collect.pubtime desc

<p>This gets the same result given the dataset you've supplied. The LINQ statement then becomes reasonably simple:</p>

<pre><code>var rows = (from c in Collect
where c.PubTime &gt;= (
    from d in Collect
    where d.Url == c.Url
    select d.PubTime).Max()
orderby c.PubTime descending
select c).Distinct();

","<p>The partitioned view is one possible approach. Since you are only selecting the foo column, are you really just checking for existence of a row in the training table via the INNER JOIN? Also, it looks like you're trying to use foo as an alias in your join, but it's not set up that way in your SELECT clause. As a result I'm guessing here on what you really want.</p>

<p>Another question... is the set of training tables static? Are you expecting to be able to add a new table with a new suffix number and have it just work?</p>

<p>Another possible solution:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
     foo
FROM
     dbo.master m
WHERE
     (training_type = '001' AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.training_data_001 WHERE foo_id = m.id)) OR
     (training_type = '002' AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.training_data_002 WHERE foo_id = m.id)) OR
     (training_type = '003' AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.training_data_003 WHERE foo_id = m.id)) OR
     (training_type = '004' AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.training_data_004 WHERE foo_id = m.id)) OR
     (training_type = '005' AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.training_data_005 WHERE foo_id = m.id))
</code></pre>

<p>If you actually want to return columns from the training data tables then you could use something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
     m.id,
     COALESCE(t1.my_col, t2.my_col, t3.my_col, t4.my_col, t5.my_col) AS my_col

     dbo.master m

When I make the call via my website application it returns nothing.  When I make the same call via SQL Server Manager it returns the expected data.</p>

<p>I put a breakpoint on the call to the adapter's <code>getData</code> method and looked at all the parameters and their values and matched them in a query from server management to make sure.  I'm sending the following query:</p>
