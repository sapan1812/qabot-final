","<p>Selectors are an internal representation of a method name in Objective-C. In Objective-C ""@selector(methodName)"" would convert a source-code method into a data type of SEL. Since you can't use the @selector syntax in Swift (rickster is on point there), you have to manually specify the method name as a String object directly, or by passing a String object to the Selector type. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>var rightBarButton = UIBarButtonItem(
    title: ""Logout"", 
    style: UIBarButtonItemStyle.Plain, 
    target: self, 
    action:""logout""

","<p>Swift <em>itself</em> doesn't use selectors â several design patterns that in Objective-C make use of selectors work differently in Swift. (For example, use optional chaining on protocol types or <code>is</code>/<code>as</code> tests instead of <code>respondsToSelector:</code> tests, and use closures wherever you can instead of <code>performSelector:</code> for better type/memory safety.)</p>

<p>But there are still a number of important ObjC-based APIs that use selectors, including timers and the target/action pattern. Swift provides the <code>Selector</code> type for working with these. (Swift automatically uses this in place of ObjC's <code>SEL</code> type.)</p>

<h3>In Swift 2.2 (Xcode 7.3) and later (including Swift 3 / Xcode 8):</h3>

<p>You can construct a <code>Selector</code> from a Swift function type using the <code>#selector</code> expression.</p>

<pre><code>let timer = NSTimer(timeInterval: 1, target: object,
                    selector: #selector(MyClass.test),
                    userInfo: nil, repeats: false)
button.addTarget(object, action: #selector(MyClass.buttonTapped),
                 forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)
view.performSelector(#selector(UIView.insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)),
                     withObject: button, withObject: otherButton)
</code></pre>

<p>The great thing about this approach? A function reference is checked by the Swift compiler, so you can use the <code>#selector</code> expression only with class/method pairs that actually exist and are eligible for use as selectors (see ""Selector availability"" below). You're also free to make your function reference only as specific as you need, as per <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Expressions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH32-ID400"" rel=""nofollow"">the new Swift 2.2 rules for function naming</a>.</p>

<p>(This is actually an improvement over ObjC's <code>@selector()</code> directive, because the compiler's <code>-Wundeclared-selector</code> check verifies only that the named selector exists. The Swift function reference you pass to <code>#selector</code> checks existence, membership in a class, and type signature.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you don't have a function reference to make a selector with (for example, with actions bound to the first responder, Cocoa KVC accessors, or methods dynamically registered in the ObjC runtime). In that case, you can construct a <code>Selector</code> from a string: e.g. <code>Selector(""paste:"")</code> â though you lose the compiler's validity checking.</p>

<p>There are a couple of extra caveats for the function references you pass to the <code>#selector</code> expression:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple functions with the same base name can be differentiated by their parameter labels using the aforementioned <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Expressions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH32-ID400"" rel=""nofollow"">syntax for function references</a> (e.g. <code>insertSubview(_:at:)</code> vs <code>insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)</code>). But if a function has no parameters, the only way to disambiguate it is to use an <code>as</code> cast with the function's type signature (e.g. <code>foo as () -&gt; ()</code> vs <code>foo(_:)</code>).</li>
<li>Swift doesn't know about the ObjC accessors for property getter/setter pairs. So, for example, given a <code>var foo: Int</code>, there isn't a <code>func setFoo(_:)</code> that you can construct a <code>#selector</code> from, even though there is a <code>Selector(setFoo:)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General notes:</h3>

<p><strong>Selector availability:</strong> The method referenced by the selector must be exposed to the ObjC runtime. This is already the case if it's in a class that (ultimately) inherits from <code>NSObject</code>, but if it's in a pure Swift class you'll need to preface that method's declaration with <code>@objc</code>. Remember that <code>private</code> symbols aren't exposed to the runtime, too â your method needs to have at least <code>internal</code> visibility.</p>

<p><strong>Selector names:</strong> Because selectors are an ObjC thing, they follow ObjC method naming rules, including colons (<code>:</code>) for each parameter. For example, the selector for a method named  <code>test()</code> is just <code>""test""</code>, but the selector for <code>test(this: String)</code> is <code>""test:""</code>, and for <code>test(this: String, andThat: Int)</code> it's <code>""test:andThat:""</code>. Note that as the relationship between Swift and ObjC evolves, the names of some ObjC methods and their Swift syntax may diverge â but you can always <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-ID53"" rel=""nofollow"">use the <code>@objc()</code> attribute</a> to control how a Swift method is exposed to ObjC.</p>

<p>You can read more about selectors under <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_26"" rel=""nofollow"">Interacting with Objective-C APIs</a> in <em>Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C</em>.</p>

<p><sup><strong>Note:</strong> Before Swift 2.2, <code>Selector</code> conformed to <code>StringLiteralConvertible</code>, so you might find old code where bare strings are passed to APIs that take selectors. You'll want to run the migratory to get those converted to <code>#selector</code> syntax.</sup></p>

","<p>As swift is in some regards more functional than object-oriented (and Arrays are structs, not objects), use the function ""find"" to operate on the array, which returns an optional value, so be prepared to handle a nil value:</p>

<pre><code>let arr:Array = [""a"",""b"",""c""]

<p><strong>Update for Swift 2.0:</strong></p>

<p><em>The old <code>find</code> function is not supported any more with Swift 2.0!</em></p>

<p>With Swift 2.0, <code>Array</code> gains the ability to find the index of an element using a function defined in an extension of <code>CollectionType</code> (which <code>Array</code> implements):</p>

<pre><code>let arr = [""a"",""b"",""c""]

let indexOfA = arr.indexOf(""a"") // 0
let indexOfB = arr.indexOf(""b"") // 1
let indexOfD = arr.indexOf(""d"") // nil
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, finding the first element in an array fulfilling a predicate is supported by another extension of <code>CollectionType</code>:</p>

<pre><code>let arr2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
let indexOfFirstGreaterThanFive = arr2.indexOf({$0 &gt; 5}) // 5
let indexOfFirstGreaterThanOneHundred = arr2.indexOf({$0 &gt; 100}) // nil
</code></pre>

<p>Note that these two functions return optional values, as <code>find</code> did before.</p>

<p>Prior to Swift 2, there wasn't a way for generic types like collections to provide methods for the concrete types derived from them (like arrays).

Just <code>import Foundation</code> (or another module that transitively imports Foundation), cast your <code>Array</code> to <code>NSArray</code>, and you can use the many search methods on <code>NSArray</code>.</p>

132,24028860,64,194,swift,How to find index of list item in Swift?,"<p>I am trying to find an item index by searching a list. Does anybody know how to do that? </p>

<p>I see there is list.StartIndex and list.EndIndex bu I want something like python's list.index(""text"")</p>
","<p>You can <code>filter</code> an array with a closure:</p>

<pre><code>var myList = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var filtered = myList.filter { $0 == 3 }  // &lt;= returns [3]
</code></pre>

<p>And you can count an array:</p>

<pre><code>filtered.count // &lt;= returns 1
</code></pre>

<p>So you can determine <em>if</em> an array includes your element by combining these:</p>

<pre><code>myList.filter { $0 == 3 }.count &gt; 0  // &lt;= returns true if the array includes 3
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to find the position, I don't see fancy way, but you can certainly do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var found: Int?  // &lt;= will hold the index if it was found, or else will be nil
for i in (0..x.count) {
    if x[i] == 3 {
        found = i
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>While we're at it, for a fun exercise let's extend <code>Array</code> to have a <code>find</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
    func find(includedElement: T -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Int? {
        for (idx, element) in enumerate(self) {
            if includedElement(element) {
                return idx
            }
        }
        return nil
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>myList.find { $0 == 3 }
// returns the index position of 3 or nil if not found

[detector enumerateMatchesInString:dateString

248,24101450,53,129,swift,How do you find out the type of an object (in Swift)?,"<p>When trying to understand a program, or in some corner-cases it's useful to be able to actually find out what type something is. I know the debugger can show you some type information, and you can usually rely on type inference to get away with not specifying the type in those situations, but still, I'd really like to have something like python's <code>type()</code></p>

<h2>dynamicType (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24049487/how-do-you-retrieve-the-type-of-an-object-in-swift"">this question</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> this has been changed in a recent version of Swift, <code>obj.dynamicType</code> now gives you a reference to the type, and not the instance with the dynamic type.</p>

<p>This one seems the most promising, but so far I haven't been able to find out the actual type</p>

<pre><code>class myClass {
    var count = 0
}

let mc = myClass()

# update: this now evaluates as true
mc.dynamicType === myClass.self
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried using a class reference to instantiate a new object, which <em>does</em> work, but oddly gave me an error saying I must add an <code>required</code> initializer:</p>

<p>works:</p>

<pre><code>class myClass {
    var count = 0
    required init() {
    }
}

let myClass2 = myClass.self
let mc2 = myClass2()
</code></pre>

<p>Still only a small step toward actually discovering the type of any given object though</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: I've removed a substantial number of now irrelevant details - look at the edit history if you're interested :)</p>
","<p>The ""dynamicType.printClassName"" code is from an example in the Swift book. There's no way I know of to directly grab a custom class name, but you can check an instances type using the ""is"" keyword as shown below. This example also shows how to implement a custom className function, if you really want the class name as a string.</p>

<pre><code>class Shape {
    class func className() -&gt; String {
        return ""Shape""
    }
}

class Square: Shape {
    override class func className() -&gt; String {
        return ""Square""
    }
}

class Circle: Shape {
    override class func className() -&gt; String {
        return ""Circle""
    }
}

func getShape() -&gt; Shape {
    return Square() // hardcoded for example
}

let newShape: Shape = getShape()
newShape is Square // true
newShape is Circle // false
newShape.dynamicType.className() // ""Square""
newShape.dynamicType.className() == Square.className() // true
</code></pre>

<p>Note that subclasses of NSObject already implement their own className function. If you're working with Cocoa, you can just use this property.</p>

<pre><code>class MyObj: NSObject {
    init() {
        super.init()
        println(""My class is \(self.className)"")
    }
}
MyObj()

","<p>I got the ugly animation problem when changing button titles in view controllers within a UITabBarController.
The titles that were originally set in the storyboard showed up for a short while before fading into their new values.</p>

<p>I wanted to iterate through all subviews and use the button titles as keys to get their localized values with NSLocalizedString, such as; </p>

<pre><code>for(UIView *v in view.subviews) {

    if ([v isKindOfClass:[UIButton class]]) {
        UIButton *btn = (UIButton*)v;
        NSString *newTitle = NSLocalizedString(btn.titleLabel.text, nil);
        [btn setTitle:newTitle];
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I found out that what's triggering the animation is really the call to btn.titleLabel.text.
So to still make use of the storyboards and have the components dynamically localized like this I make sure to set every button's Restoration ID (in Identity Inspector) to the same as the title and use that as key instead of the title;</p>

<pre><code>for(UIView *v in view.subviews) {

    if ([v isKindOfClass:[UIButton class]]) {
        UIButton *btn = (UIButton*)v;
        NSString *newTitle = NSLocalizedString(btn.restorationIdentifier, nil);

<blockquote>
  <p>Command Line</p>
  
  <p>Xcodeâs debugger includes an interactive version of the Swift language, known as the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop). Use Swift syntax to evaluate and interact with your running app or write new code in a script-like environment. The REPL is available from within LLDB in Xcodeâs console, or from Terminal.</p>

<p>I want to know how to get the REPL?</p>
","<pre><code>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

<p>then you can do one of these:    </p>

<pre><code>xcrun swift 
lldb --repl

<p>As of Xcode 6.1 - typing <code>swift</code> in the terminal launches the REPL as well.</p>

244,24099230,167,84,swift,Delegates in swift?,"<p>How does one go about making a delegate, i.e. <code>NSUserNotificationCenterDelegate</code> in swift?</p>
","<p>Here's a little help on delegates between two view controllers: </p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make a protocol in the UIViewController that you will be removing/will be sending the data.</p>

<pre><code>protocol FooTwoViewControllerDelegate{
    func myVCDidFinish(controller:FooTwoViewController,text:String)
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step2:</strong>  Declare the delegate in the sending class (i.e. UIViewcontroller)</p>

<pre><code>class FooTwoViewController: UIViewController {
    var delegate:FooTwoViewControllerDelegate! = nil
    [snip...]
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step3:</strong>  Use the delegate in a class method to send the data to the receiving method, which is any method that adopts the protocol.</p>

<pre><code>@IBAction func saveColor(sender : UIBarButtonItem) {
        delegate!.myVCDidFinish(self, text: colorLabel.text) //assuming the delegate is assigned otherwise error
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adopt the protocol in the receiving class</p>

<pre><code>class ViewController: UIViewController,FooTwoViewControllerDelegate {
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Implement the delegate method</p>

<pre><code>func myVCDidFinish(controller: FooTwoViewController, text: String) {
    colorLabel.text = ""The Color is "" +  text
    controller.navigationController.popViewControllerAnimated(true)
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Set the delegate in the prepareForSegue:</p>

<pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue!, sender: AnyObject!) {
    if segue.identifier == ""mySegue""{
        let vc = segue.destinationViewController as FooTwoViewController
        vc.colorString = colorLabel.text
        vc.delegate = self
    }
}
</code></pre>

195,24066170,173,82,swift,How to create NS_OPTIONS-style bitmask enumerations in Swift?,"<p>In Apple's documentation about interacting with C APIs, they describe the way <code>NS_ENUM</code>-marked C-style enumerations are imported as Swift enumerations. This makes sense, and since enumerations in Swift are readily provided as the <code>enum</code> value type it's easy to see how to create our own.</p>

<p>Further down, it says this about <code>NS_OPTIONS</code>-marked C-style options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swift also imports options marked with the <code>NS_OPTIONS</code> macro. Whereas
  options behave similarly to imported enumerations, options can also
  support some bitwise operations, such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>~</code>. In Objective-C,
  you represent an empty option set with the constant zero (<code>0</code>). In
  Swift, use <code>nil</code> to represent the absence of any options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that there isn't an <code>options</code> value type in Swift, how can we create a C-Style options variable to work with?</p>
","<h1>Swift 3.0</h1>

<p>Almost identical to Swift 2.0. OptionSetType was renamed to OptionSet and enums are written lower case by convention.</p>

<pre><code>struct MyOptions : OptionSet {
    let rawValue: Int

    static let firstOption  = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 0)
    static let secondOption = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 1)
    static let thirdOption  = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of providing a <code>none</code> option, the Swift 3 recommendation is to simply use an empty array literal:</p>

<pre><code>let noOptions: MyOption = []
</code></pre>

<p>Other usage:</p>

<pre><code>let singleOption = MyOptions.firstOption
let multipleOptions: MyOptions = [.firstOption, .secondOption]
if multipleOptions.contains(.secondOption) {
    print(""multipleOptions has SecondOption"")
}
let allOptions = MyOptions(rawValue: 7)
if allOptions.contains(.thirdOption) {
    print(""allOptions has ThirdOption"")
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Swift 2.0</h1>

<p>In Swift 2.0, protocol extensions take care of most of the boilerplate for these, which are now imported as a struct that conforms to <code>OptionSetType</code>. (<code>RawOptionSetType</code> has disappeared as of Swift 2 beta 2.) The declaration is far simpler:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyOptions : OptionSetType {
    let rawValue: Int

    static let None         = MyOptions(rawValue: 0)
    static let FirstOption  = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 0)
    static let SecondOption = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 1)
    static let ThirdOption  = MyOptions(rawValue: 1 &lt;&lt; 2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use set-based semantics with <code>MyOptions</code>:</p>

<pre><code>let singleOption = MyOptions.FirstOption
let multipleOptions: MyOptions = [.FirstOption, .SecondOption]
if multipleOptions.contains(.SecondOption) {
    print(""multipleOptions has SecondOption"")
}
let allOptions = MyOptions(rawValue: 7)
if allOptions.contains(.ThirdOption) {
    print(""allOptions has ThirdOption"")
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Swift 1.2</h1>

<p>Looking at the Objective-C options that were imported by Swift (<code>UIViewAutoresizing</code>, for example), we can see that options are declared as a <code>struct</code> that conforms to protocol <code>RawOptionSetType</code>, which in turn conforms to  <code>_RawOptionSetType</code>, <code>Equatable</code>, <code>RawRepresentable</code>, <code>BitwiseOperationsType</code>, and <code>NilLiteralConvertible</code>. We can create our own like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyOptions : RawOptionSetType {
    typealias RawValue = UInt
    private var value: UInt = 0
    init(_ value: UInt) { self.value = value }
    init(rawValue value: UInt) { self.value = value }
    init(nilLiteral: ()) { self.value = 0 }
    static var allZeros: MyOptions { return self(0) }
    static func fromMask(raw: UInt) -&gt; MyOptions { return self(raw) }
    var rawValue: UInt { return self.value }

    static var None: MyOptions { return self(0) }
    static var FirstOption: MyOptions   { return self(1 &lt;&lt; 0) }
    static var SecondOption: MyOptions  { return self(1 &lt;&lt; 1) }
    static var ThirdOption: MyOptions   { return self(1 &lt;&lt; 2) }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can treat this new option set, <code>MyOptions</code>, just like described in Apple's documentation: you can use <code>enum</code>-like syntax:</p>

<pre><code>let opt1 = MyOptions.FirstOption
let opt2: MyOptions = .SecondOption
let opt3 = MyOptions(4)
</code></pre>

<p>And it also behaves like we'd expect options to behave:</p>

<pre><code>let singleOption = MyOptions.FirstOption
let multipleOptions: MyOptions = singleOption | .SecondOption
if multipleOptions &amp; .SecondOption != nil {     // see note
    println(""multipleOptions has SecondOption"")
}
let allOptions = MyOptions.fromMask(7)   // aka .fromMask(0b111)
if allOptions &amp; .ThirdOption != nil {
    println(""allOptions has ThirdOption"")
}

","<p>You can't define categories (Swift extensions) with new storage; any additional properties must be <em>computed</em> rather than stored. The syntax works for Objective C because <code>@property</code> in a category essentially means ""I'll provide the getter and setter"". In Swift, you'll need to define these yourself to get a computed property; something like:</p>

<pre><code>extension String {
    public var Foo : String {
        get
        {
            return ""Foo""
        }

        set
        {
            // What do you want to do here?
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Should work fine. Remember, you can't store new values in the setter, only work with the existing available class state.</p>

","<p>With Obj-c Categories you can only add methods, not instance variables.</p>

<p>In you example you have used @property as a shortcut to adding getter and setter method declarations. You still need to implement those methods.</p>

<p>Similarly in Swift you can add use extensions to add instance methods, computed properties etc. but not stored properties.</p>

","<p>If you're using Auto Layout, I assume you've set the <strong>Bottom Space to Superview</strong> constraint. If that's the case, you simply have to update the constraint's value. Here's how you do it with a little bit of animation.</p>

    let info = notification.userInfo!

<p>The hardcoded 20 is added only to pop the textfield above the keyboard just a bit. Otherwise the keyboard's top margin and textfield's bottom margin would be touching.</p>

","<p>As in Objective-C, you can't add stored property to existing classes. If you're extending an Objective-C class (<code>UIView</code> is definitely one), you can still use <a href=""http://nshipster.com/associated-objects/"">Associated Objects</a> to emulate stored properties:</p>



<pre><code>import ObjectiveC

private var xoAssociationKey: UInt8 = 0

extension UIView {
    var xo: PFObject! {
        get {
            return objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &amp;xoAssociationKey) as? PFObject

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The association key is a pointer that should be the unique for each association. For that, we create a private global variable and use it's memory address as the key with the <code>&amp;</code> operator.

","<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Since this answer is getting a few upvotes, I would like to clarify that setters/getters in Swift are quite different than ObjC. The property becomes a <em>computed property</em> which means it does <strong>not</strong> have a backing variable such as <code>_x</code> as it would in ObjC. In the solution code below you can see the <code>xTimesTwo</code> does <strong>not</strong> store anything, but simply <em>computes</em> the result from <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH14-ID259"">Official docs on computed properties</a>.</p>

<p>The functionality you want might also be <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH14-ID262"">Property Observers</a>.</p>

<p>Setters/getters are different than they were in Objective-C.</p>

<p>What you need is:</p>

<pre><code>var x:Int

var xTimesTwo:Int {
    set {
       x = newValue / 2
    }
    get {
        return x * 2
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can modify other properties within the setter/getters, which is what they are meant for.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> From the answers. It can't be done in Swift older version than 1.2. But according to this official <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=22"">Swift Blog</a>. In Swift 1.2 that released along with XCode 6.3, You can use Swift Enum in Objective-C by adding <code>@objc</code> in front of <code>enum</code> </p>
","<p>From the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/"">Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C</a> guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Swift class or protocol must be marked with the @objc attribute to
  be accessible and usable in Objective-C. [...]</p>
  
  <p>Youâll have access to anything within a class or protocol thatâs
  marked with the @objc attribute as long as itâs compatible with
  Objective-C. This excludes Swift-only features such as those listed
  here:</p>
  
  <p>Generics Tuples / <strong>Enumerations defined in Swift</strong> / Structures defined in
  Swift / Top-level functions defined in Swift / Global variables defined in
  Swift / Typealiases defined in Swift / Swift-style variadics / Nested types /

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>My app has a main <code>container_view</code>. I have to add different other views as subviews to <code>container_view</code> in order to provide a sort of navigation.</p>

<p>So, when clicking the button to ""open"" a particular page, I need to remove allsubviews and add the new one.</p>

    view.removeFromSuperview()
}
</code></pre>
","<p>I don't know if you managed to resolve this but I have recently experienced a similar problem where the For loop left one view each time. I found this was because the self.subviews was mutated (maybe) when the removeFromSuperview() was called.</p>

<p>To fix this I did:</p>

<pre><code>let subViews: Array = self.subviews.copy()
for (var subview: NSView!) in subViews
{
    subview.removeFromSuperview()
}
</code></pre>

<p>By doing .copy(), I could perform the removal of each subview while mutating the self.subviews array. This is because the copied array (subViews) contains all of the references to the objects and is not mutated.</p>

<p>EDIT: In your case I think you would use:</p>

<pre><code>let theSubviews: Array = container_view.subviews.copy()
for (var view: NSView!) in theSubviews
{
    view.removeFromSuperview()
}

","<p>I also wrote a small library which is specialized for the mapping of the json response into an object structure. I am internally using the library json-swift from David Owens. Maybe it is useful for someone else.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/prine/ROJSONParser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/prine/ROJSONParser</a></p>

<p>Example <em>Employees.json</em></p>

<pre><code>{
""employees"": [
  {
    ""firstName"": ""John"",
    ""lastName"": ""Doe"",
    ""age"": 26
  },
  {
    ""firstName"": ""Anna"",
    ""lastName"": ""Smith"",
    ""age"": 30
  },
  {
    ""firstName"": ""Peter"",
    ""lastName"": ""Jones"",
    ""age"": 45
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<p>As next step you have to create your data model (EmplyoeeContainer and Employee).</p>

<p><em>Employee.swift</em></p>

<pre><code>class Employee : ROJSONObject {

    required init() {
        super.init();
    }

    required init(jsonData:AnyObject) {
        super.init(jsonData: jsonData)
    }

    var firstname:String {
        return Value&lt;String&gt;.get(self, key: ""firstName"")
    }

    var lastname:String {
        return Value&lt;String&gt;.get(self, key: ""lastName"")            
    }

    var age:Int {
        return Value&lt;Int&gt;.get(self, key: ""age"")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>EmployeeContainer.swift</em></p>

<pre><code>class EmployeeContainer : ROJSONObject {
    required init() {
        super.init();
    }

    required init(jsonData:AnyObject) {
        super.init(jsonData: jsonData)
    }

    lazy var employees:[Employee] = {
        return Value&lt;[Employee]&gt;.getArray(self, key: ""employees"") as [Employee]
    }()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then to actually map the objects from the JSON response you only have to pass the data into the EmployeeContainer class as param in the constructor. It does automatically create your data model.</p>

<pre><code> var baseWebservice:BaseWebservice = BaseWebservice();

  var urlToJSON = ""http://prine.ch/employees.json""

  var callbackJSON = {(status:Int, employeeContainer:EmployeeContainer) -&gt; () in
    for employee in employeeContainer.employees {
      println(""Firstname: \(employee.firstname) Lastname: \(employee.lastname) age: \(employee.age)"")
    }
  }

  baseWebservice.get(urlToJSON, callback:callbackJSON)
</code></pre>

<p>The console output looks then like the following:</p>

","<p>I just wrote a class called JSON, which makes JSON handling in Swift as easy as JSON object in ES5.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/dankogai/swift-json/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dankogai/swift-json/</a></li>

<p>Turn your swift object to JSON like so:</p>

<pre><code>let obj:[String:AnyObject] = [
    ""array"": [JSON.null, false, 0, """",[],[:]],
    ""object"":[
        ""null"":   JSON.null,
        ""bool"":   true,
        ""int"":    42,
        ""double"": 3.141592653589793,
        ""string"": ""a Î±\tå¼¾\ní¡©íº²"",
        ""array"":  [],
        ""object"": [:]
    ],
    ""url"":""http://blog.livedoor.com/dankogai/""
]

let json = JSON(obj)
json.toString()
</code></pre>

<p>...or string...</p>

<pre><code>let json = JSON.parse(""{\""array\"":[...}"")
</code></pre>

<p>...or URL.</p>

<pre><code>let json = JSON.fromURL(""http://api.dan.co.jp/jsonenv"")
Tree Traversal
</code></pre>

<p>Just traverse elements via subscript:</p>

<pre><code>json[""object""][""null""].asNull       // NSNull()
// ...
json[""object""][""string""].asString   // ""a Î±\tå¼¾\ní¡©íº²""
json[""array""][0].asNull             // NSNull()
json[""array""][1].asBool             // false
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>Just like <a href=""https://github.com/lingoer/SwiftyJSON"" rel=""nofollow"">SwiftyJSON</a> you don't worry if the subscripted entry does not exist.</p>

<pre><code>if let b = json[""noexistent""][1234567890][""entry""].asBool {
    // ....
} else {
    let e = json[""noexistent""][1234567890][""entry""].asError
    println(e)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are tired of subscripts, add your scheme like so:</p>

<pre><code>//// schema by subclassing
class MyJSON : JSON {
    init(_ obj:AnyObject){ super.init(obj) }
    init(_ json:JSON)  { super.init(json) }
    var null  :NSNull? { return self[""null""].asNull }
    var bool  :Bool?   { return self[""bool""].asBool }
    var int   :Int?    { return self[""int""].asInt }
    var double:Double? { return self[""double""].asDouble }
    var string:String? { return self[""string""].asString }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you go:</p>

<pre><code>let myjson = MyJSON(obj)
myjson.object.null
myjson.object.bool
myjson.object.int
myjson.object.double
myjson.object.string
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>When NSURLConnection receives a response, we can expect the didReceiveResponse method to be called on our behalf. At this point we simply reset our data by saying self.data = NSMutableData(), creating a new empty data object.</p>

<p>After a connection is made, we will start receiving data in the method didReceiveData. The data argument being passed in here is where all our juicy information comes from. We need to hold on to each chunk that comes in, so we append it to the self.data object we cleared out earlier.</p>

<p>Finally, when the connection is done and all data has been received, connectionDidFinishLoading is called and weâre ready to use the data in our app. Hooray!</p>

<p>The connectionDidFinishLoading method here uses the NSJSONSerialization class to convert our raw data in to useful Dictionary objects by deserializing the results from your Url.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a replacement for the <code>NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings</code> macro, or are we expected to just write our own?</p>

","<p><code>NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings</code> is, as you say, a macro. There are no macros in Swift. So much for that.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, you can easily write a Swift function to assign string names to your views in a dictionary, and then pass that dictionary into <code>constraintsWithVisualFormat</code>. The difference is that, unlike Objective-C, Swift can't see <em>your</em> names for those views; you will have to let it <em>make up</em> some <em>new</em> names.</p>

<p>[To be clear, it isn't that your Objective-C <em>code</em> could see your variable names; it's that, at macro evaluation time, the preprocessor was operating on your source code <em>as text</em> and rewriting it â and so it could just use the text of your variable names both inside quotes (to make strings) and outside (to make values) to form a dictionary. But with Swift, there is no preprocessor.]</p>

<p>So, here's what I do:</p>

<pre><code>func dictionaryOfNames(arr:UIView...) -&gt; Dictionary&lt;String,UIView&gt; {
    var d = Dictionary&lt;String,UIView&gt;()
    for (ix,v) in arr.enumerate(){
        d[""v\(ix+1)""] = v
    }
    return d
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you call it and use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>    let d = dictionaryOfNames(myView, myOtherView, myFantasicView)
    myView.addConstraints(
        NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormat(
            ""H:|[v2]|"", options: nil, metrics: nil, views: d)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>The catch is that it is <em>up to you</em> to realize that the name for <code>myOtherView</code> in your visual format string will be <code>v2</code> (because it was second in the list passed in to <code>dictionaryOfNames()</code>). But I can live with that just to avoid the tedium of typing out the dictionary by hand every time.</p>

<p>Of course, you could equally have written more or less this same function in Objective-C. It's just that you didn't bother because the macro already existed!</p>

<p>Is it possible to force these to be called during initialization?</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Let's say I have this class</p>

    var someProperty: AnyObject {
        didSet {
            doStuff()

    }

    func doStuff() {
        // do stuff now that someProperty is set
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I created the method <code>doStuff</code>, to make the processing calls more concise, but I'd rather just process the property within the <code>didSet</code> function.  Is there a way to force this to call during initialization?</p>

<h3> Update </h3>

<p>I decided to just remove the convenience intializer for my class and force you to set the property after initialization.  This allows me to know <code>didSet</code> will always be called.  I haven't decided if this is better overall, but it suits my situation well. </p>

","<p><strong>Update for Swift 2.0</strong>: Now functions behave identically to methods, and for both, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first parameter has no external name; and</li>
<li>the other parameters have an external name identical to the internal name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, the rules below still apply, except that the <code>#</code> shorthand syntax is now gone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a more general answer: functions behave differently when defined as true functions outside a class, and when defined as methods. Moreover, init methods have a special rule.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Suppose you define this:</p>

<pre><code>func multiply1(f1: Double, f2: Double) -&gt; Double {
    return f1 * f2
}
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter names are here only <strong>local</strong> to the function, and cannot be used when calling the function:</p>

<pre><code>multiply1(10.0, 10.0)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to force using named parameters when calling the function, you can. Prefix each parameter declaration with its <strong>external</strong> name. Here, the external name of <code>f1</code> is <code>f1param</code>, and for <code>f2</code>, we use the shorthand where we prefix it by <code>#</code> to indicate that the local name is to be used as the external name as well:</p>

<pre><code>func multiply2(f1param f1: Double, #f2: Double) -&gt; Double {
    return f1 * f2
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, named parameters must be used:</p>

<pre><code>multiply2(f1param: 10.0, f2: 10.0)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Things are different for methods. By default, all but the first parameter are named, as you've discovered. Suppose we have this, and consider the <code>multiply1</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>class Calc {
    func multiply1(f1: Double, f2: Double) -&gt; Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
    func multiply2(f1param f1: Double, f2: Double) -&gt; Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
    func multiply3(f1: Double, _ f2: Double) -&gt; Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you have to use the name of the second (and following, if any) parameters:</p>

<pre><code>let calc = Calc()
calc.multiply1(1.0, f2: 10.0)
</code></pre>

<p>You can force to use a named param for the first argument by providing an external name for it, like for functions (or prefixing its local name with <code>#</code> if you want to use the same external name as its local name). Then, you have to use it:</p>

<pre><code>calc.multiply2(f1param: 10.0, f2: 10.0)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can declare an external name of <code>_</code> for the other following arguments, indicating that you want to call your method without using named parameters, like this:</p>

<pre><code>calc.multiply3(10.0, 10.0)
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Interoperability note:</strong> If you prefix <code>class Calc</code> with the <code>@objc</code> annotation, then you can use it from Objective-C code, and it is equivalent to this declaration (look at parameter names):</em></p>

<pre><code>@interface Calc
- (double)multiply1:(double)f1 f2:(double)f2;
- (double)multiply2WithF1param:(double)f1 f2:(double)f2;
- (double)multiply3:(double)f1 :(double)f2;
@end
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Init Methods</h3>

<p>The rule differs a bit for <code>init</code> methods, where all parameters have an external name by default. For instance, this works:</p>

<pre><code>class Calc {
    init(start: Int) {}
    init(_ start: String) {}
}

let c1 = Calc(start: 6)
let c2 = Calc(""6"")
</code></pre>

<p>Here, you have to specify <code>start:</code> for the overload that accepts an <code>Int</code>, but you must omit it for the overload that accepts a <code>String</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Interoperability note:</strong> this class would get exported to Objective-C like this:</em></p>

<pre><code>@interface Calc
- (instancetype)initWithStart:(NSInteger)start __attribute__((objc_designated_initializer));
- (instancetype)init:(NSString *)start __attribute__((objc_designated_initializer));
@end
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>Assume you define a closure type like this:</p>

<pre><code>typealias FancyFunction = (f1: Double, f2: Double) -&gt; Double
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter names will behave very similar to those in a method.  You will have to provide the names to the parameters when calling the closure unless you explicitly set the external name to _.</p>

<p>For example, executing the closure:</p>

<pre><code>fund doSomethingInteresting(withFunction: FancyFunction) {
    withFunction(f1: 1.0, f2: 3.0)
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>As a rule of thumb: even if you dislike them, you should probably try to keep using named parameters at least whenever two parameters have the same type, in order to disambiguate them. I'd also argue that it's good to also name at least all <code>Int</code> and <code>Boolean</code> parameters.</p>

968,25686490,28,46,swift,iOS 8 Auto cell height - Can't scroll to last row,"<p>I am using iOS 8 new self-sizing cells. Visually it works good - each cell gets its right size. However, if I try to <strong>scroll to the last row</strong>, the table view doesn't seem to know its right size. Is this a bug or is there a fix for that?</p>

<h2>Here's how to recreate the problem:</h2>

<p>Using this project - <a href=""https://github.com/smileyborg/TableViewCellWithAutoLayoutiOS8"">TableViewCellWithAutoLayoutiOS8</a> (referenced from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/18746930/442896"">this SO answer</a>), I got the auto-resizing cells as expected. </p>

<p>However, if I am calling the <em>scrollToRowAtIndexPath</em> function, like this:</p>

<pre><code>tableView.scrollToRowAtIndexPath(NSIndexPath(forRow: model.dataArray.count - 1, inSection: 0), atScrollPosition: .Bottom, animated: true)
</code></pre>

<p>I <strong>do not get to the last row</strong> - It only gets me around halfway there. </p>

<p>Even by trying to use a lower level function like this:</p>

<pre><code>tableView.setContentOffset(CGPointMake(0, tableView.contentSize.height - tableView.frame.size.height), animated: true)
</code></pre>

<p>The result is not as expected, it won't get to the end. If I click it a lot of times or wait a few moments, eventually it will get to the right place. It seems the tableView.contentSize.height is not set correctly, so the iOS ""doesn't know"" where that last cell is.</p>

<p>Would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p><strong>Update: Jun 24, 2015</strong></p>

<p>Apple has addressed most of these bugs as of the iOS 9.0 SDK. All of the issues are fixed as of iOS 9 beta 2, including scrolling to the top &amp; bottom of the table view without animation, and calling <code>reloadData</code> while scrolled in the middle of the table view. </p>

<p>Here are the remaining issues that have not been fixed yet:</p>

<ol>
<li>When using a large estimated row height, scrolling to the last row with animation causes the table view cells to disappear.</li>
<li>When using a small estimated row height, scrolling to the last row with animation causes the table view to finish scrolling too early, leaving some cells below the visible area (and the last row still offscreen).</li>
</ol>

<p>A new bug report (rdar://21539211) has been filed for these issues relating to scrolling with animation.</p>

<p><strong>Original Answer</strong></p>

<p>This is an Apple bug with the table view row height estimation, and it has existed since this functionality first was introduced in iOS 7. I have worked directly with Apple UIKit engineers and developer evangelists on this issue -- they have acknowledged that it is a bug, but do not have any reliable workaround (short of disabling row height estimation), and did not seem particularly interested in fixing it.</p>

<p>Note that the bug manifests itself in other ways, such as disappearing table view cells when you call <code>reloadData</code> while scrolled partially or fully down (e.g. <code>contentOffset.y</code> is significantly greater than 0).</p>

<p>Clearly, with iOS 8 self sizing cells, row height estimation is critically important, so Apple really needs to address this ASAP.</p>

<p>I filed this issue back on Oct 21 2013 as Radar #15283329. <strong>Please do file duplicate bug reports so that Apple prioritizes a fix.</strong></p>

<p>You can attach this simple <a href=""http://cl.ly/151p0J1X2K13"">sample project</a> to demonstrate the issue. It is based directly on Apple's own sample code.</p>

<p><strong>If you can define a hash function</strong> on your object type then you can use a Dictionary.  <strong>If the objects are orderable</strong>, then you could define a Tree.  <strong>If the objects are only comparable with <code>==</code></strong> then you'll need to iterate over the set elements to detect a preexisting object.</p>

<pre><code>// When T is only Equatable
class Set&lt;T: Equatable&gt; {

   return false
  }

  func insert (that: T) {
    if (!hasItem (that))
      items.append (that)
  }

</code></pre>

<p>The above is an example of building a Swift <code>Set</code>; the example used objects that are only <code>Equatable</code> - which, while a common case, doesn't necessarily lead to an efficient <code>Set</code> implementations (O(N) search complexity - the above is an example).</p>

  <p>In Swift, classes can be declared within the definition of a function, allowing for mock objects to be extremely self-contained. Just declare a mock inner-class, override and [sic] necessary methods:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>func testFetchRequestWithMockedManagedObjectContext() {
    class MockNSManagedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext {
        override func executeFetchRequest(request: NSFetchRequest!, error: AutoreleasingUnsafePointer&lt;NSError?&gt;) -&gt; [AnyObject]! {

    ...
}

<p>The ability to create a subclass of your external dependency in the local scope plus the addition of <code>XCTestExpectation</code> solve a lot of the same problems as <code>OCMock</code>.</p>

<p>The one thing that a library such as <code>OCMock</code> provides that is very useful are its ""verify"" methods to ensure that the mock classes were called.  It's possible to manually add this, but the automatic addition is nice.</p>

<p>If thatâs the case then how are we going to create nested dictionaries? </p>

<p>Imagine we have a <code>plist</code> that holds String, Array and Dictionary items in it . If Iâm allowed to hold only the same of type of items (either string, array etc.) then how am I going to use different types of items stored in the plist?</p>

<p>How do I put different types in the same dictionary in Swift?</p>
","<p>As has been suggested, you can use the <code>Any</code> type to represent a plist dictionary's values. But then how do you work with the data? Cast every value any time you look it up from the dictionary? That's really messy. A better, more type-safe way to model a plist would be to take advantage of Swift's enums, also known as algebraic data types or discriminated unions. They let you specify exactly what types are permitted in the dictionary and avoid ever having to cast. Here's an implementation, explained:</p>

<pre><code>// An atomic (i.e. non-collection) data type in a plist.
enum PListNode {
  case PLN_String(String)
  case PLN_Integer(Int)
  case PLN_Float(Double)
  case PLN_Bool(Bool)
  case PLN_Date(CFDate)
  case PLN_Data(CFData)
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the most atomic level, only the above data types may be stored in a plist. Each 'node' in the plist can ultimately can only be <em>one</em> of these types. So we create an enum which lets us specify this.</p>

<pre><code>// A value that can be stored in a plist Dictionary's key-value pair.
enum PListValue {
  case PLV_Node(PListNode)
  case PLV_Array(PListNode[])
  case PLV_Dictionary(Dictionary&lt;String, Box&lt;PListValue&gt;&gt;)
}

typealias PList = Dictionary&lt;String, Box&lt;PListValue&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A plist is basically a dictionary of key-value pairs, and <em>each value</em> can be either an atomic (i.e. non-collection) value; or it can be an array of atomic values; or it can be a dictionary of string-plist value pairs. The above enum expresses these constraints, and the typealias gives the plist type an easy-to-remember name.</p>

<p>Given the above types, we can completely express any given plist <em>in a type-safe way,</em> e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>// Example translated from
// https://developer.apple.com/library/Mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/plist.5.html
let myPlist: PList = [
  ""Year Of Birth"": Box(PLV_Node(PLN_Integer(1965)))
, ""Pets Names"":    Box(PLV_Array([]))
, ""Picture"":       Box(PLV_Node(PLN_Data(...)))
, ""City of Birth"": Box(PLV_Node(PLN_String(""Springfield"")))
, ""Name"":          Box(PLV_Node(PLN_String(""John Doe"")))
, ""Kids Names"":    Box(
    PLV_Array([PLN_String(""John""), PLN_String(""Kyra"")])
  )
]
</code></pre>

<p>What it means to be type-safe here is that you can process any given plist using a <code>switch</code> statement and cover all possibilities without the need for any casting. You're eliminating a whole class of potential runtime errors. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>// See https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH12-XID_189 for explanation
switch myPlist[""Year Of Birth""] {
  case Box(.PLV_Node(let plvNodeValue)):
    ...
  case Box(.PLV_Array(let plvArrayValue)):
    ...
  case Box(.PLV_Dictionary(let plvDictionaryValue)):
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it's necessary to wrap up recursive data structures in a 'box' (a pointer to the actual value) to keep their sizes finite.</p>

","<p>That's because <code>keys</code> returns <code>LazyMapCollection&lt;[Key : Value], Key&gt;</code>, which is can't be subscripted with an Int. One way to handle this is to advance the dictionary's <code>startIndex</code>, by the integer that you wanted to subscript by, for example:</p>

<pre><code>let intIndex = 1 // where intIndex &lt; myDictionary.count
let index = myDictionary.startIndex.advancedBy(intIndex) // index 1
myDictionary.keys[index]
</code></pre>

<p>Another possible solution, would be to initialize an array with <code>keys</code> as input, then you can use integer subscripts on the result:</p>

<pre><code>let firstKey = Array(myDictionary.keys)[0] // or .first
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, dictionaries are inherently unordered, so don't expect the key at a given index to always be the same.</p>

<p>In Objective-C, the main (heh) bit of per-app configuration that the <code>UIApplicationMain</code> function provides is designating one of your app's custom classes as the delegate of the shared <code>UIApplication</code> object.

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, whether I put the return value as C or as Self, nothing works except for the case where I prefix <code>class C</code> with <code>final</code>. But if I want to subclass C then nothing would work. Is there any way around this?</p>
","<p>The problem is that you're making a promise that the compiler can't prove you'll keep.</p>

<p>So you created this promise: Calling <code>copy()</code> will return its own type, fully initialized.</p>

<p>But then you implemented <code>copy()</code> this way:</p>

<pre><code>func copy() -&gt; Self {
    return C()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm a subclass that doesn't override <code>copy()</code>. And I return a <code>C</code>, not a fully-initialized <code>Self</code> (which I promised). So that's no good. How about:</p>

<pre><code>func copy() -&gt; Self {
    return Self()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that won't compile, but even if it did, it'd be no good. The subclass may have no trivial constructor, so <code>D()</code> might not even be legal. (Though see below.)</p>

<p>OK, well how about:</p>

<pre><code>func copy() -&gt; C {
    return C()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, but that doesn't return <code>Self</code>. It returns <code>C</code>. You're still not keeping your promise.</p>

<p>""But ObjC can do it!"" Well, sort of. Mostly because it doesn't care if you keep your promise the way Swift does. If you fail to implement <code>copyWithZone:</code> in the subclass, you may fail to fully initialize your object. The compiler won't even warn you that you've done that.</p>

<p>""But most everything in ObjC can be translated to Swift, and ObjC has <code>NSCopying</code>."" Yes it does, and here's how it's defined:</p>

<pre><code>func copy() -&gt; AnyObject!
</code></pre>

<p>So you can do the same (there's no reason for the ! here):</p>

<pre><code>protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -&gt; AnyObject
}
</code></pre>

<p>That says ""I'm not promising anything about what you get back."" You could also say:</p>

<pre><code>protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -&gt; Copyable
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's a promise you can make.</p>

<p>But we can think about C++ for a little while and remember that there's a promise we <em>can</em> make. We can promise that we and all our subclasses will implement specific kinds of initializers, and Swift will enforce that (and so can prove we're telling the truth):</p>

<pre><code>protocol Copyable {
  init(copy: Self)
}

class C : Copyable {
  required init(copy: C) {
    // Perform your copying here.
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that is how you should perform copies.</p>

<p>We can take this one step further, but it uses <code>dynamicType</code>, and I haven't tested it extensively to make sure that is always what we want, but it should be correct:</p>

<pre><code>protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -&gt; Self
  init(copy: Self)
}

class C : Copyable {
  func copy() -&gt; Self {
    return self.dynamicType(copy: self)
  }

  required init(copy: C) {
    // Perform your copying here.
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we promise that there is an initializer that performs copies for us, and then we can at runtime determine which one to call, giving us the method syntax you were looking for.</p>

<p>It is now possible to import your own frameworks into a playground. This provides a way to share code between your applications and playgrounds, which can both import your frameworks. To do this, your playground must be in the same workspace as the project that produces your framework. You must have already built your framework. If it is an iOS framework, it must be built for a 64-bit run destination (e.g. iPhone 5s). You must have an active scheme which builds at least one target (that target's build location will be used in the framework search path for the playground). Your ""Build Location"" preference (in advanced ""Locations"" settings) should not be set to ""Legacy"". If your framework is not a Swift framework the ""Defines Module"" build setting must be set to ""Yes"". Once all these conditions are fulfilled, importing your framework will work in a playground.</p>

<pre><code>var corX = 0
var corY = 0
var panzer = UIImageView(frame: CGRectMake(corX, corY, 30, 40))

<p>The problem is that a Swift default initializer cannot refer to the value of another property, because at the time of initialization, the property doesn't exist yet (because the instance itself doesn't exist yet). Basically, in <code>panzer</code>'s default initializer you are implicitly referring to <code>self.corX</code> and <code>self.corY</code> - but there is no <code>self</code> because <code>self</code> is exactly what we are in the middle of creating.</p>

<p>One workaround is to make the initializer lazy:</p>

<pre><code>class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var corX : CGFloat = 0
    var corY : CGFloat = 0
    lazy var panzer : UIImageView = UIImageView(frame: CGRectMake(self.corX, self.corY, 30, 40))
    // ...
}

<p>That's legal because <code>panzer</code> doesn't get initialized until later, when it is first referred to by your actual code. By that time, <code>self</code> and its properties exist.</p>

  <p>Stored Properties and Instance Variables</p>
  
  <p>If you have experience with Objective-C, you may know that it provides two ways to store values and references as part of a class instance. In addition to properties, you can use instance variables as a backing store for the values stored in a property.</p>
  
  <p>Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. A Swift property does not have a corresponding instance variable, and the backing store for a property is not accessed directly. This approach avoids confusion about how the value is accessed in different contexts and simplifies the propertyâs declaration into a single, definitive statement. All information about the propertyâincluding its name, type, and memory management characteristicsâis defined in a single location as part of the typeâs definition.</p>

  <h2>Stored Properties and Instance Variables</h2>
  
  <p>If you have experience with Objective-C, you may know that it provides
  two ways to store values and references as part of a class instance.
  In addition to properties, you can use instance variables as a backing
  store for the values stored in a property.</p>
  
  <p>Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. A
  Swift property does not have a corresponding instance variable, and
  the backing store for a property is not accessed directly. This
  approach avoids confusion about how the value is accessed in different
  contexts and simplifies the propertyâs declaration into a single,
  definitive statement. All information about the propertyâincluding its
  name, type, and memory management characteristicsâis defined in a
  single location as part of the typeâs definition.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Implicitly unwrapped optional allows you to treat it in the Swift code like a normal value type with the caveat that accessing it when it is <code>nil</code> will interrupt your program with runtime error. Youâd guard against that using <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_430"">if statements</a>, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_432"">optional binding</a>

<p>Implicitly unwrapped optionals are pragmatic compromise to make the work in hybrid environment that has to interoperate with existing Cocoa frameworks and their conventions more pleasant, while also allowing for stepwise migration into safer programing paradigm â without null pointers â enforced by the Swift compiler.

<p>My thought is it means you can expect an unwrapped <code>sender</code> object so you don't need to try an unwrap it.</p>
","<p>This isn't quite a duplicate â there's some subtlety to implicitly unwrapped optionals <em>in function signatures</em> beyond their usage elsewhere.</p>

<p>You see implicitly unwrapped optionals in API imported from ObjC because that's the closest Swift approximation of an object that's expected to be there but which can be nil. It's a compromise for imported API â you can address these variables directly like in ObjC, and you can test them for nil using Swift optional syntax. (There's more about Apple's rationale for this in the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014-407/"">Advanced Interoperability talk</a> from WWDC14.) This pattern also applies to the <code>IBAction</code> declarations inserted by Interface Builder, since those methods are in effect getting called from ObjC code, too.</p>

<p>As you seem to have suspected, Swift wraps the possible nil in an optional when bridging from ObjC, but the <code>!</code> in your function implementation's declaration unwraps the value so you can use it directly. (At your own risk.)</p>

<p>Since Swift 1.2 (Xcode 6.2 in Spring 2015), ObjC APIs can be annotated with <code>nonnull</code> and <code>nullable</code>, in which case the Swift interface to those APIs uses either a non-optional type or a fully optional type. (And since Swift 2.0 / Xcode 7.0, nearly all of Apple's APIs are audited to use nullability annotations, so their Swift signatures don't use much <code>!</code> anymore.)</p>

<p>What's less well-known about this is that you're free to change the optionality of parameters when you implement your own Swift functions that get called by ObjC. If you want the compiler to enforce that <code>sender</code> in your action method can never be nil, you can take the <code>!</code> off the parameter type. If you want the compiler to make sure you always test the parameter, change the <code>!</code> to a <code>?</code>.</p>

","<p>Properties in Objective-C correspond to properties in Swift. There are two ways to implement properties in Objective-C and Swift:</p>

You don't get to specify the name of the backing instance variable because, well, there are currently no instance variables in Swift. You must always use the property instead of its backing instance variable.</li>
<li>Manually implemented properties in Objective-C -- these are called ""computed properties"" in Swift. You declare them in the class declaration like <code>var topSpeed : Double { get { getter code here } set { setter code here } }</code> (for <code>readwrite</code> properties), or <code>var topSpeed : Double { getter code here }</code> (for <code>readonly</code> properties).</li>

        } else {
            // Do something with your businesses array. 
        }
    }

","<p>From Your Piece of code its very clear that you are making mistakes at two place one is setting <code>delegate</code> and second is setting Media type <code>imag.mediaTypes = kUTTypeImage</code></p>

<li><strong>structs</strong> should be used when
there is not a finite number of valid instances (e.g. enum cases) and
the struct also does not form a complete definition of an object, but
rather an attribute of an object </li>

","<p>ChristopheD's and Jack Wu's answers are good, but I feel they don't touch on enums, or miss their importance. Swift enums are (meant to be) a full implementation of algebraic data types. Classes and structs are traditionally used to model data in object-oriented languages, but enums are usually limited to being used as a convenient way to limit the value of a variable to a limited number of possibilities. E.g. (C++):</p>

<pre><code>enum MaritalStatus { Unmarried, Married, Divorced, WidowedOrWidowered };
MaritalStatus m = Unmarried;
</code></pre>

<p>Swift enums can do the above but they can do a lot more. Of course the Language Guide has a pretty good <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH12-XID_189"">barcode modelling example</a> but the best example I know of that really drives home the point of modelling data with algebraic data types is Scott Wlaschin's presentation: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/ddd-with-fsharptypesystemlondonndc2013"">http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/ddd-with-fsharptypesystemlondonndc2013</a></p>

<p>You would probably benefit from going through the whole presentation but really to 'get' the point all you need to see is slide 60 where he shows how to model a 'payment method' in a typical line-of-business app.</p>

<p>The examples in the presentation are in F# but F# isn't <em>that</em> far off from Swift and you can pretty easily map between them. E.g., the payment methods enum in Swift would look like:</p>

<pre><code>enum PaymentMethod {
  case Cash // No extra data needed.
  case Cheque(Int) // Cheque #.
  case Card(CardType, CardNumber) // 2 pieces of extra data.
}
</code></pre>

<p>The point of the above is that each order's payment method can be only one of the above three methods. Anything else will not be allowed by the compiler. This is a very succinct alternative to building entire class hierarchies to model these almost trivial things.</p>

<p>The presentation really takes off from there and the best part is Swift can do almost everything that F# can in terms of data modelling, using optional types, etc.</p>

Before dismissing the <code>UIAlertController</code>, I want to validate the input of the <code>UITextField</code>. Based on the validation I want to dismiss the <code>UIAlertController</code> or not. But I have no clue how to prevent the dismissing action of the <code>UIAlertController</code> when a button is pressed. Has anyone solved this problem or any ideas where to start ? I went to google but no luck :/ Thanks! </p>
","<p>You're correct: if the user can tap a button in your alert, the alert will be dismissed. So you want to prevent the user from tapping the button! It's all just a matter of disabling your UIAlertAction buttons. If an alert action is disabled, the user can't tap it to dismiss.</p>

<p>To combine this with text field validation, use a text field delegate method or action method (configured in the text field's configuration handler when you create it) to enable/disable the UIAlertActions appropriately depending on what text has (or hasn't) been entered. </p>

<p>Here's an example. We created the text field like this:</p>

<pre><code>alert.addTextFieldWithConfigurationHandler {
    (tf:UITextField!) in
    tf.addTarget(self, action: ""textChanged:"", forControlEvents: .EditingChanged)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have a Cancel action and an OK action, and we brought the OK action into the world disabled:</p>

<pre><code>(alert.actions[1] as UIAlertAction).enabled = false
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequently, the user can't tap OK unless there is some actual text in the text field:</p>

<pre><code>func textChanged(sender:AnyObject) {
    let tf = sender as UITextField
    var resp : UIResponder = tf
    while !(resp is UIAlertController) { resp = resp.nextResponder() }
    let alert = resp as UIAlertController
    (alert.actions[1] as UIAlertAction).enabled = (tf.text != """")
}

346,24180630,1,23,swift,"Why does the Swift language guide suggest using Int ""even when values are known to be non-negative""?","<p>This is a question about programming style in Swift, specifically <code>Int</code> vs <code>UInt</code>.</p>

<p>The Swift Programming Language Guide advises programmers to use the generic signed integer type <code>Int</code> even when variables are known to be non-negative. From <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_411"">the guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use UInt only when you specifically need an unsigned integer type with the same size as the platformâs native word size. If this is not the case, Int is preferred, even when the values to be stored are known to be non-negative. A consistent use of Int for integer values aids code interoperability, avoids the need to convert between different number types, and matches integer type inference, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, <code>UInt</code> will be 32-bit unsigned on 32-bit architectures and 64-bit unsigned on 64-bit architectures so there is no performance benefit to using <code>Int</code> over <code>UInt</code>.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Swift guide gives a later example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>let age = -3<br>
  assert(age >= 0, ""A person's age cannot be less than zero"")<br>
  // this causes the assertion to trigger, because age is not >= 0  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, a <em>runtime</em> issue could be caught at <em>compile</em> time if the code had been written as:</p>

<pre><code>let age:UInt = -3  
// this causes a compiler error because -3 is negative
</code></pre>

<p>There are many other cases (for example anything that will index a collection) where using a <code>UInt</code> would catch issues at compile time rather than runtime.</p>

<p>So the question: is the advice in the Swift Programming Language guide sound, and do the benefits of using <code>Int</code> ""even when the values to be stored are known to be non-negative"" outweigh the safety advantages of using <code>UInt</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Additional note:</strong> Having used Swift for a couple of weeks now its clear that for interoperability with <em>Cocoa</em> <code>UInt</code> is required. For example the <code>AVFoundation</code> framework uses unsigned integers anywhere a ""count"" is required (number of samples / frames / channels etc). Converting these values to <code>Int</code> could lead to serious bugs where values are greater than <code>Int.max</code></p>
","<p>It says in your question..
""A consistent use of Int for integer values aids code interoperability, avoids the need to convert between different number types, and matches integer type inference, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference.""</p>

<p>This avoids issues such as assigning an Int to an UInt.  Negative Int values assigned to UInts result in large values instead of the intended negative value.  The binary representation of both doesn't differentiate one type from the other.  </p>

<p>Also, both are classes, one not descended from the other.  Classes built receive Ints cannot receive UInts without overloading, meaning converting between the two would be a common task of UInts are being used when most of the framework receives Ints.  Converting between the two can become a non-trival task as well.  </p>

<p>The two previous paragraphs speak to ""interoperability"" and ""converting between different number types"".  Issues that are avoided if UInts aren't used.</p>

<p>However, since I was following along tutorials available online(specifically <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KImie4ZMwk&amp;index=2&amp;list=WL"">this one</a>), I added another method to determine the height of the cell with <code>tableView(tableView: UITableView!, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!)</code>.
In the tutorial that I was following, it told me to add <code>cell.layoutIfNeeded()</code>, so I added that too. </p>

<pre><code>override func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; CGFloat {

    var cell = tableView!.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(kCellIdentifier) as GroupFeedCell

    // Configure the cell
    if let frc = self.fetchedResultsController {
        let feed = frc.objectAtIndexPath(indexPath) as GroupFeed
        cell.titleLabel.text = feed.name
        if let message = feed.message {
            cell.bodyLabel.text = message
        }
    }

    // Layout the cell
    cell.layoutIfNeeded()

    // Get the height
    var height : CGFloat = cell.contentView.systemLayoutSizeFittingSize(UILayoutFittingCompressedSize).height
    return height
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I ran the program, although the table view still displayed the dynamic heights of the cells correctly, it displayed the errors like this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I tried to figure out what might have gone wrong, and spend good amount of time on it, and I figured out that whenever I delete <code>cell.layoutIfNeeded()</code> method, then the constraints error disappears.</p>

<p>And it seemed that among the constraints that are conflicting, <code>UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width</code> was not the one I added, and other than that, the all of the constraints looked innocent to me. I tried to search through what could generate <code>UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width</code> constraints, but I couldn't get the satisfying explanation in my situation. I would like to know what would be the cause of this error message and how to resolve this problem.</p>

<p>Also, can someone explain what would be the purpose of calling <code>cell.layoutIfNeeded()</code> method inside calculating height of the cell, and when it would be necessary? Most of the tutorials that were covering dynamic height <code>UITableViewCell</code> utilized this method, although my program still displayed cells correctly without that method call, and whenever I tried to use that method, it caused the exceptions.</p>
","<p>It could be that the conflicting constraints are because the first two constraints define the width of the label as being 16pts less than the width of the cell, but the third constraint, the <code>UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width</code> wants to make the label a different size.</p>

<p>You might try to lower the values of the content compression resistance/hugging properties to allow the label to ignore its intrinsic size.</p>

<h2>Getting Closer</h2>

<p>This is the closest I've been able to get if it helps anyone get closer to the solution:</p>

<p>You can create a protocol that can fulfills what we need to do, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>protocol Addable {
    func +(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
    init()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then extend each of the types we want to support that conforms to the above protocol:</p>

<pre><code>extension Int : Addable {
}

extension Double : Addable {
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then add an extension with that constraint:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
    func sum&lt;T : Addable&gt;(min:T) -&gt; T
    {
        return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(min) { $0 + $1 }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which can now be used against numbers that we've extended to support the protocol, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3].sum(0) //6
[1.1,2.1,3.1].sum(0.0) //6.3
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to get it working without having to supply an argument, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>func sum&lt;T : Addable&gt;(x:T...) -&gt; T?
{
    return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(T()) { $0 + $1 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The modified method still works with 1 argument:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3].sum(0) //6
</code></pre>

<p>But is unable to resolve the method when calling it with no arguments, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3].sum() //Could not find member 'sum'
</code></pre>

<p>Adding <code>Integer</code> to the method signature also doesn't help method resolution:</p>

<pre><code>func sum&lt;T where T : Integer, T: Addable&gt;() -&gt; T?
{
    return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(T()) { $0 + $1 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But hopefully this will help others come closer to the solution.</p>

","<p><strong>Update for Swift 1.2</strong></p>

<p>Since Swift 1.2, <code>if let</code> allows unwrapping multiple optionals, so you can now just write this, as in your example:</p>

<pre><code>if let x = someDict[someKey], y = someDict[someOtherKey] { â¦ }
</code></pre>

<p>You can even interleave conditions such as:</p>

<pre><code>if let x = someDict[someKey] where x == ""value"", y = someDict[someOtherKey] { â¦ }
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p><strong>This used to be valid before Swift 1.2</strong></p>

<p>Here's how you would do it without an ugly force-upwrapping:</p>

case let (.Some(a), .Some(b)):
    println(""match"")
default:
    println(""no match"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Still pretty verbose, actually.</p>

<p>This works because an optional type of the form <code>Type?</code> is actually shorthand for <code>Optional&lt;Type&gt;</code>, which is an enum that looks roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>enum Optional&lt;T&gt; {
    case None
    case Some(T)
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use pattern matching as for any other enum.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've seen people write helper functions like this one (sorry for the lack of attribution, I don't remember where I saw it):</p>

<pre><code>func unwrap&lt;A, B&gt;(a: A?, b: B?) -&gt; (A, B)? {

    case let (.Some(a), .Some(b)):
        return (a, b)
    default:
        return nil
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can keep using the <code>if let</code> construct, namely like this:</p>

<pre><code>if let (a, b) = unwrap(dict[""a""], dict[""b""]) {
    println(""match: \(a), \(b)"")

<pre><code>let i:Int = [1,2,3].sum()
let d:Double = [1.1,2.2,3.3].sum()
</code></pre>
","<p>I think I found a reasonable way of doing it, borrowing some ideas from <a href=""https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz"">scalaz</a> and starting from your proposed implementation.
Basically what we want is to have typeclasses that represents monoids.</p>

<p>In other words, we need:</p>

<ul>
<li>an associative function</li>
<li>an identity value (i.e. a zero)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a proposed solution, which works around the swift type system limitations</p>

<p>First of all, our friendly <code>Addable</code> typeclass</p>

<pre><code>protocol Addable {
    class func add(lhs: Self, _ rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
    class func zero() -&gt; Self
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's make <code>Int</code> implement it.</p>

<pre><code>extension Int: Addable {
    static func add(lhs: Int, _ rhs: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return lhs + rhs
    }

    static func zero() -&gt; Int {
        return 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. Now we have all the pieces we need to build a generic `sum function:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
    func sum&lt;T : Addable&gt;() -&gt; T {
        return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(T.zero()) { T.add($0, $1) }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's test it</p>

<pre><code>let result: Int = [1,2,3].sum() // 6, yay!
</code></pre>

<p>Due to limitations of the type system, you need to explicitly cast the result type, since the compiler is not able to figure by itself that <code>Addable</code> resolves to <code>Int</code>.</p>

<p>So you cannot just do:</p>

<pre><code>let result = [1,2,3].sum()
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's a bearable drawback of this approach.</p>

<p>Of course, this is completely generic and it can be used on any class, for any kind of monoid.
The reason why I'm not using the default <code>+</code> operator, but I'm instead defining an <code>add</code> function, is that this allows <strong>any</strong> type to implement the <code>Addable</code> typeclass. If you use <code>+</code>, then a type which has no <code>+</code> operator defined, then you need to implement such operator in the global scope, which I kind of dislike.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's how it would work if you need for instance to make both <code>Int</code> and <code>String</code> 'multipliable', given that <code>*</code> is defined for <code>Int</code> but not for `String.</p>

<pre><code>protocol Multipliable {
    func *(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
    class func m_zero() -&gt; Self
}

func *(lhs: String, rhs: String) -&gt; String {
    return rhs + lhs
}
extension String: Multipliable {
    static func m_zero() -&gt; String {
        return """"
    }
}
extension Int: Multipliable {
    static func m_zero() -&gt; Int {
        return 1
    }
}

extension Array {
    func mult&lt;T: Multipliable&gt;() -&gt; T {
        return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(T.m_zero()) { $0 * $1 }
    }
}

let y: String = [""hello"", "" "", ""world""].mult()
</code></pre>

<p>Now array of <code>String</code> can use the method <code>mult</code> to perform a reverse concatenation (just a silly example), and the implementation uses the <code>*</code> operator, newly defined for <code>String</code>, whereas <code>Int</code> keeps using its usual <code>*</code> operator and we only need to define a zero for the  monoid.</p>

<p>For code cleanness, I much prefer having the whole typeclass implementation to live in the <code>extension</code> scope, but I guess it's a matter of taste.</p>

<p>This question is <strong>NOT how to sum numbers</strong>, but how to <strong>create a generic Array Extension</strong> to do it.</p>

<h2>Getting Closer</h2>

<p>This is the closest I've been able to get if it helps anyone get closer to the solution:</p>

<p>You can create a protocol that can fulfills what we need to do, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>protocol Addable {
    func +(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
    init()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then extend each of the types we want to support that conforms to the above protocol:</p>

<pre><code>extension Int : Addable {
}

extension Double : Addable {
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then add an extension with that constraint:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
    func sum&lt;T : Addable&gt;(min:T) -&gt; T
    {
        return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(min) { $0 + $1 }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which can now be used against numbers that we've extended to support the protocol, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3].sum(0) //6
[1.1,2.1,3.1].sum(0.0) //6.3
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to get it working without having to supply an argument, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>func sum&lt;T : Addable&gt;(x:T...) -&gt; T?
{
    return self.map { $0 as T }.reduce(T()) { $0 + $1 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The modified method still works with 1 argument:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3].sum(0) //6

","<p>The industry standard behaviour of switch can lead to bugs similar to <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/02/extremely-critical-crypto-flaw-in-ios-may-also-affect-fully-patched-macs/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Go to Fail""</a>.</p>

<p>Basically the code doesn't always do exactly what it looks like the code will do when reading over it, which leads to code auditors skipping over critical bugs.</p>

<p>To counter that, Apple has decided switch statements should not work the same in Swift as the industry standard. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an automatic break at the end of every case. It's impossible for more than one case statement to execute.</li>
<li>If it's theoretically possible for one of the case statements to be missed, then the code will not compile at all. In swift one of the case statements will always execute, no matter what value is provided. If you provide an enum, every enum value must be handled. If a new value is added to an existing enum the code won't compile until new case statements are added. If you provide a 32 bit integer, you must handle every possible value of a 32 bit int.</li>

        case SHA512: return CC_SHA512_DIGEST_LENGTH;
        default: return 0;
    }
}

<p>Then in Swift:</p>

<pre><code>class SwiftHMAC
{
    // Swift will automatically pull the enum from Obj-C

    func calculate(algorithm:HMACAlgorithm, key:Byte[], data:Byte[]) -&gt; Byte[]
    {
        let computedHMAC = HMAC.calculateWithAlgorithm(algorithm, forKey: key, andData: data)

        computedHMAC.getBytes(&amp;rawBytes)

        return rawBytes
    }
}

  <p>Swiftâs String type is bridged seamlessly to Foundationâs NSString
  class. If you are working with the Foundation framework in Cocoa or
  Cocoa Touch, the entire NSString API is available to call on any

  requires an NSString instance.</p>

<p>Following that approach, the <code>NSArray</code> API <em>should</em> be available on <code>Array</code>, but it isn't because the native Swift <code>Array</code> is a primitive (most likely a struct or similar), so you have to <em>""convert""</em> it to an <code>NSArray</code>.</p>

<p>I mean I know I could just bridge the Array to <code>NSArray</code> and do it there ^^<br/>
But there must be a 'native' way of doing this</p>

<p>P.S. for the <code>containsObject</code> I guess I could filter the array too but for <em>indexOf</em>?</p>
","<p>You can use the built-in <code>find</code>, and thus avoid bridging to Objective-C â but only if your element type is <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/SwiftStandardLibraryReference/Equatable.html"">Equatable</a>. (If it isn't Equatable, you can make it so with a comparison function and an extension.)</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>func == (lhs:Piece,rhs:Piece) -&gt; Bool {
    return lhs.val == rhs.val
}

class Piece:Equatable,Printable {
    var val : Int
    var description : String { return String(val) }
    init (_ v:Int) {
        val = v
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can call <code>find(arr,p)</code> where <code>arr</code> is an <code>Array&lt;Piece&gt;</code> and <code>p</code> is a <code>Piece</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have this, you can develop utilities based on it. For example, here's a global function to remove an object from an array without bridging to Objective-C:</p>

<pre><code>func removeObject&lt;T:Equatable&gt;(inout arr:Array&lt;T&gt;, object:T) -&gt; T? {
    if let found = find(arr,object) {
        return arr.removeAtIndex(found)
    }
    return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>And test it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [Piece(1), Piece(2), Piece(3)]
removeObject(&amp;arr,Piece(2))
println(arr)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You can do this for NSObject subclasses too. Example:</p>

<pre><code>func == (v1:UIView, v2:UIView) -&gt; Bool {
    return v1.isEqual(v2)
}
extension UIView : Equatable {}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can call <code>find</code> on an Array of UIView. It's sort of a pain in the butt, though, having to do this for every single class where you want to be able to use <code>find</code> on an Array of that class. I have filed an enhancement request with Apple requesting that all NSObject subclasses be considered Equatable and that <code>==</code> should fall back on <code>isEqual:</code> <em>automatically</em>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Starting in Seed 3, this <em>is</em> automatic for UIView and other NSObject classes. So <code>find</code> now just works for them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> Starting in Swift 2.0, <code>indexOf</code> will exist as a method:</p>

<pre><code>let s = [""Manny"", ""Moe"", ""Jack""]
let ix = s.indexOf(""Moe"") // 1
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, it takes a function that returns Bool:</p>

<pre><code>let ix2 = s.indexOf {$0.hasPrefix(""J"")} // 2
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works only on collections of Equatable, since obviously you cannot locate a needle in a haystack unless you have a way of identifying a needle when you come to it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> Swift 2.0 also introduces protocol extensions. This means I can rewrite my global function <code>removeObject</code> as a method!</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>extension RangeReplaceableCollectionType where Generator.Element : Equatable {
    mutating func removeObject(object:Self.Generator.Element) {
        if let found = self.indexOf(object) {
            self.removeAtIndex(found)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since Array adopts RangeReplaceableCollectionType, now I can write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [Piece(1), Piece(2), Piece(3)]
arr.removeObject(Piece(2))
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, happy day!</p>

","<p>In the <code>viewForAnnotation</code> delegate method, set the <code>image</code> based on which <code>annotation</code> the method is being called for.  </p>

<p>Be sure to do this <em>after</em> the view is dequeued or created (and not only in the <code>if anView == nil</code> part).  Otherwise, annotations that use a dequeued view will show the image of the annotation that used the view previously.</p>

<p>With the basic <code>MKPointAnnotation</code>, one crude way to tell annotations apart is by their <code>title</code> but that's not very flexible.</p>

<p>A better approach is to use a custom annotation class that implements the <code>MKAnnotation</code> protocol (an easy way to do that is to subclass <code>MKPointAnnotation</code>) and add whatever properties are needed to help implement the custom logic.</p>

<p>In the custom class, add a property, say <code>imageName</code>, which you can use to customize the image based on the annotation.</p>

<p>This example subclasses <code>MKPointAnnotation</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomPointAnnotation: MKPointAnnotation {

info1.title = ""Info1""
info1.subtitle = ""Subtitle""
info1.imageName = ""1.png""

info2.title = ""Info2""

This makes working with Core Foundation sound way simpler than it actually is...</p>

<p>I am trying to work with a CFArray that is returned from CoreText.  I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>let lines: CFArrayRef  = CTFrameGetLines(frame)
</code></pre>

<p>I see two possible ways to access members of this array.  Neither is working for me right now.</p>

<hr>

<p>Way #1 - Use the CFArray directly</p>

<pre><code>let line: CTLineRef = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(lines, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>This yields the error ""'ConstUnsafePointer&lt;()>' in not convertible to 'CTLineRef'"".  Casting does not seem to change this error.</p>

<p>Similarly, I would love to use lines ""interchangeably"" as a Swift array like it says that I can.  However,</p>

<pre><code>let line: CTLineRef = lines[0]
</code></pre>

<p>yields the error ""'CFArrayRef' does not have a member named 'subscript'""</p>

<hr>

<p>Way #2 - Convert the CFArray to a Swift array</p>

<pre><code>var linesArray: Array = [CTLineRef]()
linesArray = bridgeFromObjectiveC(lines, linesArray.dynamicType)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, I declared a Swift array and set it equal to the bridged CFArray.  This compiles without error, but when I run it, I get an EXC_BREAKPOINT crash on the second line.  Perhaps I'm not using the Swift language correctly on this one...</p>
","<p>Here is how to do this, based on the current state of the Swift compiler and Swift documentation.  Hopefully this gets cleaned up in later betas.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Since Beta 5, reinterpretCast has been renamed to unsafeBitCast, and a CTLine object must be sent to it as an input.  Way #2 still does not work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Way #1 - Use the CFArray directly</p>

<pre><code>let line: CTLine = reinterpretCast(CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(lines, 0))
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding Gary Makin's comments - The Ref can be dropped from CTLineRef, but this does not change ARC vs non-ARC.  According to Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C pages 53-54, ref and non-ref are identical to the compiler.  Attempting to call CFRelease causes a compiler error.</p>

<hr>

<p>Way #2 - Convert the CFArray to a Swift array - <strong>Does not currently work</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, we want to convert lines to a Swift array of CTLine objects since we know that's what is returned by CTFrameGetLines, giving us type safety after the conversion.  Probably due to a compiler bug, the array can be converted to an [AnyObject] array, but not to [CTLine].  According to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WorkingWithCocoaDataTypes.html"">Apple's documentation</a>, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>let linesNS: NSArray  = CTFrameGetLines(frame)
let linesAO: [AnyObject] = linesNS as [AnyObject]
let lines: [CTLine] = linesAO as [CTLine]
</code></pre>

<p>This converts CFArray to NSArray, then NSArray to Swift Array [AnyObject], then downcasts that array to the specific type CTLine.  This compiles, but when it is run, there is an EXC_BREAKPOINT crash on the last line.</p>

<p><em>The Swift Programming Language</em> iBook chapter <em>""Type Alias Declaration""</em> doesn't actually state anything about which types <em>cannot</em> be aliased. But it simply looks like that <em>partial types</em> (like generics without placeholders specified) are not allowed.</p>

<p>If you feel that this something Swift should do, file a Radar (bugreport) with Apple.</p>

<p>While researching for this answer, I noticed that the <em>partial type</em> problem not only affects <code>typealias</code> but is visible elsewhere as well:</p>

I started with a fresh project, chose iOS Application -> Single View Application template.</p>

<p>Replaced the testExample with the code as shown below,  Added ViewController to the test target. Similar results.  This template has a single view controller of type ViewController, nothing else in the storyboard. </p>

<pre><code>  func testExample() {


      var storyBoard: UIStoryboard?
      var anyVC: AnyObject?
      var viewController: ViewController?

      storyBoard = UIStoryboard(name:""Main"", bundle: nil)
      XCTAssert(storyBoard != nil, ""Test Not Configured Properly"")

      anyVC = storyBoard?.instantiateInitialViewController()
      viewController = anyVC as? ViewController
      XCTAssert(viewController != nil, ""Test Not Configured Properly"")

      // This is an example of a functional test case.
      XCTAssert(true, ""Pass"")

    }

<p>Response from Apple...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Engineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based
  on the following:</p>
  
  <p>We can't really make this any easier than specifying the bundle. You
  might say, ""oh, let's swizzle -[NSBundle mainBundle]"", but lots of
  call sites that reference a bundle don't go through there (or go
  through the CF API). One might say then ""ok, well then how about we at
  least swizzle -[UIImage imageNamed:]"". The problem here is that there
  is no single replacement for the main bundle. You might have multiple
  live view bundles (either frameworks or apps) loaded in at once, so we
  can't just pick one to be the main bundle.</p>
  
  <p>Developers need to be aware of bundles and how to get images from a
  bundle. Developers should be using
  UIImage(named:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection:) for all image lookups.</p>

The macro is expanded in the code, so if <code>_cmd</code> appears in the macro, then it is inserted into the source where it is used, and so the method name can be used inside the macro. However, such macros do not exist in Swift. Plus macros are compile-time, so a compile-time mechanism like <code>__FUNCTION__</code> would work similarly.</li>
<li>You can define a C function that takes <code>self</code> and <code>_cmd</code>, and use it (the same function) as the implementation of multiple methods, by adding it using <code>class_addMethod</code> and <code>class_replaceMethod</code>, and the <code>_cmd</code> inside the function will help distinguish between the different method calls. However, <code>class_addMethod</code> and <code>class_replaceMethod</code> are not available in Swift.</li>
<li>Method swizzling is also a process that messes with the implementation of a method. Since in swizzling you swap the implementations of two methods, <code>_cmd</code> will help reveal the actual method name used in the call, which may not match the method that the code is in in the source code, since implementations are swapped. I guess method swizzling may still be possible in Swift, since <code>method_exchangeImplementations</code> is still available in Swift. But in method swizzling, the method you swap in is tailored for the method it is swapping with, so if it is called, there is no ambiguity which method name is being called.</li>
<li>In the case where you manually get the <code>IMP</code> (implementing function) of a method, and manually call it with a different selector. In this case, the inside of the function can see the different selector in <code>_cmd</code>. However, you don't have to worry about this in Swift because the methods that get the <code>IMP</code> are unavailable.</li>

}
</code></pre>

<p>This returns nil which is a problem. From what I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25141829/swift-closure-with-alamofire"">here</a>, this is because the request can take a while so the closure doesn't execute till after the return. The suggested solution of moving the return into the closure does not work for me and the compiler just yells (adding <code>-&gt;String</code> after <code>(request,response,JSON,error)</code> which gives ""'String' is not a subtype of void""). Same goes for the other solution provided.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Even some source code that is not related to this problem, that uses AlamoFire, would be helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>One way to handle this is to pass a closure (I usually call it a <code>completionHandler</code>) to your <code>siteInfo</code> function and call that inside <code>Alamofire.request</code>'s closure:</p>

<pre><code>func siteInfo(completionHandler: (String?, NSError?) -&gt; ()) -&gt; () {
    Alamofire.request(.GET, MY_API_END_POINT).responseJSON {
        (request, response, JSON, error) in

        let info = JSON as? NSDictionary // info will be nil if it's not an NSDictionary
        let str = info?[""access_key""] as? String // str will be nil if info is nil or the value for ""access_key"" is not a String

        completionHandler(str, error)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then call it like this (don't forget error handling):</p>

<pre><code>siteInfo { (str, error) in
    if str != nil {
        // Use str value
    } else {
        // Handle error / nil value
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>In the comments you asked:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how would you save the info you collect from the get request if you
  can only do stuff inside the closure and not effect objects outside of
  the closure? Also, how to keep track to know when the request has
  finished?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can save the result of the get request to an instance variable in your class from inside the closure; there's nothing about the closure stopping you from doing that. What you do from there really depends on, well, what you want to do with that data. </p>

<h2>How about an example?</h2>

<p>Since it looks like you're getting an access key form that get request, maybe you need that for future requests made in other functions. </p>

<p>In that case, you can do something like this:</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Asynchronous programming is a huge topic; way too much to cover here. This is just one example of how you might handle the data you get back from your asynchronous request.</em></p>

<pre><code>public class Site {
    private var _accessKey: String?

    private func getAccessKey(completionHandler: (String?, NSError?) -&gt; ()) -&gt; () {

        // If we already have an access key, call the completion handler with it immediately
        if let accessKey = self._accessKey {
            completionHandler(accessKey, nil)
        } else { // Otherwise request one
            Alamofire.request(.GET, MY_API_END_POINT).responseJSON {
                (request, response, JSON, error) in

                let info = JSON as? NSDictionary // info will be nil if it's not an NSDictionary
                let accessKey = info?[""access_key""] as? String // accessKey will be nil if info is nil or the value for ""access_key"" is not a String

                self._accessKey = accessKey
                completionHandler(accessKey, error)
            }
        }
    }

    public func somethingNeedingAccessKey() {
        getAccessKey { (accessKey, error) in
            if accessKey != nil {
                // Use accessKey however you'd like here
                println(accessKey)
            } else {
                // Handle error / nil accessKey here
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that setup, calling <code>somethingNeedingAccessKey()</code> the first time will trigger a request to get the access key. Any calls to <code>somethingNeedingAccessKey()</code> after that will use the value already stored in <code>self._accessKey</code>. If you do the rest of <code>somethingNeedingAccessKey</code>'s work inside the closure being passed to <code>getAccessKey</code>, you can be sure that your <code>accessKey</code> will always be valid. If you need another function that needs <code>accessKey</code>, just write it the same way <code>somethingNeedingAccessKey</code> is written.</p>

<pre><code>public func somethingElse() {
    getAccessKey { (accessKey, error) in
        if accessKey != nil {
            // Do something else with accessKey
        } else {
            // Handle nil accessKey / error here
        }
    }
}

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p><strong>Update for Xcode 7:</strong> This issue has been solved with Xcode 7 beta 2.
Optional Core Data properties are now defined as optional properties
in the managed object subclasses generated by Xcode. It is no longer
necessary to edit the generated class definition.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(Previous answer:)</em></p>

<p>When creating the <code>NSManagedObject</code> subclasses, Xcode does not define optional properties for those attributes which are marked as ""optional"" in the Core Data model inspector.
This looks like a bug to me.</p>

<p>As a workaround, you can cast the property to
an  optional (<code>as String?</code> in your case) and then test it with optional binding</p>

<pre><code>if let notice = someManagedObject.noticeText as String? {
    println(notice)
} else {
    // property not set
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your case that would be</p>

<pre><code>if let notice = formQuestions[indexPath.row].noticeText as String? {
    println(notice)
} else {
    // property not set
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of Xcode 6.2, this solution does not work anymore
and crashes with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS runtime exception
(compare <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29031080/swift-detecting-an-unexpected-nil-value-in-a-non-optional-at-runtime-casting-a"">Swift: detecting an unexpected nil value in a non-optional at runtime: casting as optional fails</a>)</p>

<p>The ""Old answer"" solution below still works.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(Old answer:)</em></p>

<p>As @Daij-Djan already stated in a comment, you have to define the property for an 
optional Core Data attribute as <em>optional</em> or <em>implicitly unwrapped optional</em>:</p>

<pre><code>@NSManaged var noticeText: String? // optional
@NSManaged var noticeText: String! // implicitly unwrapped optional
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, Xcode does not define the optional properties correctly when creating
the NSManagedObject subclasses, which means that you have to re-apply the changes
if you create the subclasses again after a model change.</p>

<p>Also this seems to be still undocumented, but both variants worked in my test case.</p>

<p>You can test the property with <code>== nil</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if formQuestions[indexPath.row].noticeText == nil {
    // property not set
}
</code></pre>

<p>or with an optional assignment:</p>

<pre><code>if let notice = formQuestions[indexPath.row].noticeText {
    println(notice)
} else {
    // property not set

176,24050500,2,11,swift,Swift isa pointer remapping or other supported method swizzling,"<p>Do Swift classes have something like an isa pointer that can be remapped? </p>

<p>We've seen that Swift <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24020950/404201"">uses a more static method dispatch</a> than objective-C, which (unless a class dervices from Foundation/NSObject) prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how we'll implement method interception-based dynamic features like the observer pattern, notifications, etc? Currently all this stuff is provided by the Objective-C layer, and can be easily integrated into Swift. But, if we want to provide these kinds of features in a framework (or app) of our own, is it necessary to implement them in Objective-C? I would assume there's a way to do it 'natively'. </p>

<p>Another kind of swizzling common to objective-C is remapping the isa-pointer to generate a sub-class on the fly. Is this kind of swizzling supported in Swift? If not what <strong><em>is</em></strong> the supported way of intercepting arbitrary method invocations?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>As @jatoben points out, as of arm64 isa-remapping must be done by calling object_setClass() and not by accessing the value directly. This is still referred to as 'isa pointer swizzling'</em></p>
","<p>I can't answer your question about swift ""isa"" equivalent, but I think I know part of the answer to your underlying question.</p>

<p><em>Property Observers</em> seem to be the built-in means for the Observer Pattern. Instead of runtime discovery of ""type"" (RTTI, what-have-you) it is woven in explicitly.</p>

<p>From 'The Swift Programming Language' page 345:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Property observers observe and respond to changes in a property's
  value. Property observers are called every time a property's value is
  set, even if the new value is the same as the property's current
  value.</p>
  
  <p>You can add property observers to any stored properties you define,
  apart from lazy stored properties. You can also add property observers
  to any inherited property (whether stored or computed) by overriding
  the property within a subclass.</p>
  
  <p>You have the option to define either or both of these observers on a
  property:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>willSet is called just before the value is stored.</li>
  <li>didSet is called immediately after the new value is stored.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure how this is all going to work out, but I am intrigued.</p>

<p>Relying on run-time type discovery also seems to run counter to strong static type orthodoxy.</p>

","<p>Your application is crashing because you try to access a <code>not optional variable</code> that is <strong>nil</strong>. This is not allowed in swift. To fix your problem just add in the <code>NSManagedObject</code> subclass a <code>?</code> to made the property optional:</p>

<p>Using breakpoints I have determined that it is not even getting past the class declaration for the app delegate. I tried checking all of the classes in my Main.storyboard file as well to make sure everything was linked properly, again as far as I can tell it is. Would really appreciate some more ideas on how to fix this!! Thanks!</p>

<p>I've created a class called MyView, which extends from UIView. In my controller, I've got a MyView variable (declared as @IBOutlet var newView: MyView). I go into IB and drag a UIView onto the window and give it a class of MyView.</p>

<p>Whenever I've done similar in Objective C, I'm then able to click on the View Controller button at the top of the app window, select the variable and drag it down to the control to link the two together. When I try it in Swift, it refuses to recognise that the view is there.</p>

<p>If I change the class of the variable in the controller to UIView, it works fine. But not with my custom view.</p>

<p>Has anyone else got this problem? And is it a feature, or just my idiocy?</p>

","<p>I've had a similar problem, and I think it's partially a caching issue and partially just an Xcode6/Swift issue. The first step I found was required was to make sure that the view controller .swift file would be loaded in the Assistant Editor when choosing ""automatic"".</p>

<p>With Xcode finding that both the files are linked I could sometimes control-drag from the view/button/etc. from the IB to the .swift file, but often had to drag from the empty circle in the gutter of the <code>@IBOutlet var newView:MyView</code> line to the view I wanted it to match up to.</p>

<p>If you can't get the file to load in the Assistant Editor then I found that doing the following would often work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the custom class from the IB view</li>
<li>Clean the project (cmd + K)</li>
<li>Close/reopen Xcode</li>
<li>Possibly clean again?</li>
<li>Add the custom class back to the view</li>
<li>Hope it works :)</li>

","<p>I have figured it myself, for those who look for an explanation read ahead;</p>

<p>There are multiple ways of using Sockets to communicate with local application or a remote server.</p>

<p>The problem described in the original post was to get the Input/Output streams and get them to work. <strong>(At the end of this post there's a reference to another post of mine explaining how to use those streams)</strong></p>

<p>The <em>NSStream</em> class has a static method (class function in swift) called <strong><em>getStreamsToHost</em></strong>.
All you have to prepare is a NSHost objected initialized with a real host address, a port number, a reference to a NSInputStream obj and also for a NSOutputStream obj.
Then, you can use the streams as shown here and explained in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24840297/swift-only-reading-from-nsinputstream/25284703#25284703"">reference post</a>.</p>

<p>look at this simple code;</p>

<pre><code>let addr = ""127.0.0.1""
let port = 4000

var host :NSHost = NSHost(address: addr)
var inp :NSInputStream?
var out :NSOutputStream?

NSStream.getStreamsToHost(host, port: port, inputStream: &amp;inp, outputStream: &amp;out)

let inputStream = inp!
let outputStream = out!
inputStream.open()
outputStream.open()

var readByte :UInt8 = 0
while inputStream.hasBytesAvailable {
    inputStream.read(&amp;readByte, maxLength: 1)
}

// buffer is a UInt8 array containing bytes of the string ""Jonathan Yaniv."".
outputStream.write(&amp;buffer, maxLength: buffer.count)
</code></pre>

<p>Before executing this simple code, I launched ncat to listen on port 4000 in my terminal and typed ""Hello !"" and left the socket opened for communication.</p>

<pre><code>Jonathans-MacBook-Air:~ johni$ ncat -l 4000
Hello !
Jonathan Yaniv.
Jonathans-MacBook-Air:~ johni$ 
</code></pre>

<p>After launching the code, you can see that I have received the string  ""Jonathan Yaniv.\n"" to the terminal before the socket was closed.</p>

<p>I hope this saved some headache to some of you. 
If you have more questions give it a shot, I hope I'll be able to answer it.</p>

589,24717460,5,10,swift,Can't make weak reference to closure in Swift,"<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried writing it without making it weak, and there doesn't seem to be a leak. So maybe the question is no longer necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>In Objective-C ARC, when you want to have a closure be able to use itself inside of the closure, the block cannot capture a strong reference to itself, or it will be a retain cycle, so instead you can make the closure capture a weak reference to itself, like so:</p>

<pre><code>// This is a simplified example, but there are real uses of recursive closures
int (^fib)(int);
__block __weak int (^weak_fib)(int);
weak_fib = fib = ^(int n) {
  if (n &lt; 2)
    return n;
  else
    return weak_fib(n-1) + weak_fib(n-2);
};
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to translate this to Swift:</p>

<pre><code>var fib: (Int -&gt; Int)?
fib = { [weak fib] (n: Int) in // 'weak' cannot be applied to non-class type 'Int -&gt; Int'
  if n &lt; 2 {
    return n
  } else {
    return fib!(n-1) + fib!(n-2)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the Swift compiler won't allow me to declare a function to be captured weakly (<code>'weak' cannot be applied to non-class type 'Int -&gt; Int'</code>). <code>[unowned fib]</code> also doesn't work (<code>'unowned' cannot be applied to non-class type '(Int -&gt; Int)?'</code>).</p>

<p>I know that functions are not class types in Swift. However, they are reference types and they do participate in reference counting. Therefore, shouldn't there be a way to make them weak or unowned references?</p>

<p>How would I write a recursive closure in Swift that doesn't have a retain cycle?</p>
","<p>Looks like this isn't possible at the moment; you might want to <a href=""http://bugreport.apple.com"">file a bug</a>.</p>

<p>But you can use an actual <code>func</code>tion to achieve the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>func fib(n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    if n &lt; 2 {
        return n
    } else {
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    }
}

fib(10) // 55
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Computer science fun time!</strong> For a more direct translation of your code, we can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Strict_fixed_point_combinator"">the Z combinator</a>, with help from Swift's built-in curried function definitions:</p>

<pre><code>func Z&lt;T, U&gt;(f: (T -&gt; U, T) -&gt; U)(x: T) -&gt; U {
    return f(Z(f), x)
}

let fib = Z { (fib: Int -&gt; Int, n: Int) in
    if n &lt; 2 {
        return n
    } else {
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    }
}

fib(x: 10) // 55

// (Note the name 'x' should not be required here.
//  It seems seems to be a bug in Beta 3, since the curried function in the
//  Swift guide doesn't work as advertised either.)

<p>Is the parameter name constant by default? Can I change it to a variable?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Priyanka</p>
","<p><strong>[In Swift >= 3.0]</strong> Function parameters are defined as if by <code>let</code> and thus are constants.  You'll need a local variable if you intend to modify the parameter.  As such:</p>

<pre><code>func someFunction (parameterName:Int) {
  var localParameterName = parameterName
  // Now use localParameterName
  localParameterName = 2;
  var a = localParameterName;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[In Swift &lt; 3.0]</strong> Declare the argument with <code>var</code> as in:</p>

<pre><code>func someFunction(var parameterName:Int) {
  parameterName = 2;
  var a = parameterName;
}
</code></pre>

<p>use of <code>inout</code> has a different semantics.  </p>

<p>[Note that ""variable parameters"" will disappear in a future Swift version.]  Here is the Swift documentation on <em>""variable parameters""</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Function parameters are constants by default. Trying to change the
  value of a  function parameter from within the body of that function
  results in a compile-time  error. This means that you canât change the
  value of a parameter by mistake.</p>
  
  <p>However, sometimes it is useful for a function to have a variable copy of a  parameterâs value to work with. You can avoid defining a
  new variable yourself within  the function by specifying one or more
  parameters as variable parameters instead.  Variable parameters are
  available as variables rather than as constants, and give a  new
  modifiable copy of the parameterâs value for your function to work
  with.</p>
  
  <p>Define variable parameters by prefixing the parameter name with the keyword var: ...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excerpt From: Apple Inc. âThe Swift Programming Language.â</p>

<p>If you actually want to change the value stored in a location that is passed into a function, then, as @conner noted, an <code>inout</code> parameter is justified.  Here is an example of that [<strong>In Swift >= 3.0</strong>]:</p>

<pre><code>  1&gt; var aValue : Int = 1
aValue: Int = 1
  2&gt; func doubleIntoRef (place: inout Int) { place = 2 * place }
  3&gt; doubleIntoRef (&amp;aValue)
  4&gt; aValue
$R0: Int = 2
  5&gt; doubleIntoRef (&amp;aValue) 
  6&gt; aValue 
$R1: Int = 4

590,24717460,1,10,swift,Can't make weak reference to closure in Swift,"<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried writing it without making it weak, and there doesn't seem to be a leak. So maybe the question is no longer necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>In Objective-C ARC, when you want to have a closure be able to use itself inside of the closure, the block cannot capture a strong reference to itself, or it will be a retain cycle, so instead you can make the closure capture a weak reference to itself, like so:</p>

<pre><code>// This is a simplified example, but there are real uses of recursive closures
int (^fib)(int);
__block __weak int (^weak_fib)(int);
weak_fib = fib = ^(int n) {
  if (n &lt; 2)
    return n;
  else
    return weak_fib(n-1) + weak_fib(n-2);
};
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to translate this to Swift:</p>

<pre><code>var fib: (Int -&gt; Int)?
fib = { [weak fib] (n: Int) in // 'weak' cannot be applied to non-class type 'Int -&gt; Int'
  if n &lt; 2 {
    return n
  } else {
    return fib!(n-1) + fib!(n-2)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the Swift compiler won't allow me to declare a function to be captured weakly (<code>'weak' cannot be applied to non-class type 'Int -&gt; Int'</code>). <code>[unowned fib]</code> also doesn't work (<code>'unowned' cannot be applied to non-class type '(Int -&gt; Int)?'</code>).</p>

<p>I know that functions are not class types in Swift. However, they are reference types and they do participate in reference counting. Therefore, shouldn't there be a way to make them weak or unowned references?</p>

<p>How would I write a recursive closure in Swift that doesn't have a retain cycle?</p>
","<p>It looks like there is no way to declare weak/unowned reference to the function; at lest for now. As workaround you can wrap your code in a class definition and have <code>unowned</code> reference to the instance:</p>

<pre><code>class Fib {
    @lazy var calc:(Int) -&gt; Int = {
        [unowned self] (n: Int) -&gt; Int in
        if n &lt; 2 {
            return n
        } else {
            return self.calc(n-1) + self.calc(n-2)
        }

<p>edit: a couple of clarifications. Teams and Event have a multi-to-multi, unordered relationship.</p>
","<p>Yesss!! I found the answer!</p>

<p>I had created a new function in the class Events.swift (the other side of the relationship). </p>

<p>I had written the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation
import CoreData

class Event: NSManagedObject {

    @NSManaged var timeStamp: NSDate
    @NSManaged var teams: NSSet

}

extension Event {

    func addTeamToEvent(team:Teams) {
        var teamz = self.mutableSetValueForKey(""teams"")
        teamz.addObject(team)
    }

    func getNumberOfTeams() -&gt; Int {
        return self.teams.count;
    }

    func getTeams() -&gt; [Teams] {
        var tmpsak: [Teams]
        tmpsak = self.teams.allObjects as [Teams]
        tmpsak = self.teams.allObjects as [Teams]

        return tmpsak
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>which I thought was unrelated. However, renaming getTeams to getTeamsAsArray removed the problem. I am guessing that CoreData, when filling in the other end of the relationship, uses a built-in function called getTeams() (since the other class was called Teams). I accidentally overrode(?) it, causing it to fail.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions, and I hope this can be helpful to someone else!</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, a bug with similar symptoms was identified a few years ago (and appears to still be present), that shows itself in auto-generated code when using <strong>ordered</strong> many-to-many relationships.</p>

605,24749150,6,9,swift,"iOs 8, start playing sound when in the background, alarm clock app","<p>I know there are many questions on SOF, but this is the ""newest"" one. The thing is, I'm trying to create and alarm app, and I know for a fact that there are alarm apps out there that works perfectly ( somehow ), even if the app is not running and is in the background.</p>

<p>My question is: how do you start playing sound <strong>after</strong> your app is already in the background ?? </p>

<p>UILocalNotification is great, but you'll only get <code>application:(_:didReceiveLocalNotification:)</code> after the user has already clicked on your notification, so playing sound using AVAudioPlayer didn't work, i want to play sound regardless weather the user clicks on it or doesn't. Of course with <code>Required background modes: App plays audio or streams audio/video using AirPlay</code> in <code>info.plist</code> already set. Once the music starts playing, it keeps playing even if i go to the background.</p>

<p>I don't want to use UILocalNotificaation sound coz it's limited to 30 secs and only the able to play the sounds that are bundled with the application.</p>

<p>Any insights ? thoughts ?? </p>

<p>Sample code:</p>

<pre><code>    var notif = UILocalNotification()
    notif.fireDate = self.datePicker.date
    notif.alertBody = ""test""
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().scheduleLocalNotification(notif)
</code></pre>

<p>the above code gets called when the user selects and alarm and clicks save.</p>

<p>and here's what's happening in AppDelegate:</p>

<pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: NSDictionary?) -&gt; Bool {
    NSLog(""launched"")
    application.registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: UIUserNotificationType.Sound | UIUserNotificationType.Alert |
        UIUserNotificationType.Badge, categories: nil
        ))
    AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, error: nil)
    AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true, error: nil)

    self.sound = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource(""sound"", ofType: ""caf""))
    self.audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(contentsOfURL: sound, error: nil)

    return true
}

func application(application: UIApplication!, didReceiveLocalNotification notification: UILocalNotification!){
    audioPlayer.play()
    NSLog(""received local notif"")


}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to hold a strong reference to the <code>AVAudioPlayer</code> btw, so it won't get released, and the <code>audioplayer.play()</code> won't do anything...</p>
","<p>Finally, I managed to do it with NSTimer.</p>

<pre><code>func applicationWillResignActive(application: UIApplication) {
    var timer = NSTimer(fireDate: NSDate(timeIntervalSinceNow: 20), interval: 60.0, target: self, selector: Selector(""playAlarm""), userInfo: nil, repeats: false)
    NSRunLoop.currentRunLoop().addTimer(timer, forMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode)
}
func playAlarm() {
    self.sound = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource(""sound"", ofType: ""caf""))
    self.audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer(contentsOfURL: sound, error: nil)
    audioPlayer.play()
}
</code></pre>

<p>and somewhere else a UILocalNotification is synced with this timer, for a good user experience.</p>

","<p>I'm coming from the ruby world where ""Hello, (optionalName)"" would return ""Hello, "", i.e. if optionalName is nil then interpolate the empty string. Currently if optionalName is nil Swift prints ""Hello, nil"" and if it's not nil it prints something like ""Hello, Optional(""John"")"". When using ""Hello, (optionalName!)"" then it prints ""Hello, John"" and if optionalName is nil it causes a runtime error.

<p>why in book it is suggested to use the let?</p>
","<p>Your confusion arises because you're using println to display optionalName, and println is smart enough to handle optional values and unwrap them as necessary.  If you used the hypothetically similar code:</p>

<pre><code>if optionalName {
    greeting = ""Hello, "" + optionalName
}
</code></pre>

<p>you would get an error because you can't concatenate a String and a String?  You have three ways around that</p>

<p>First, you can use conditional unwrapping after you do the check, but this is inefficient because if you reference optionalName more than once, since you have to unwrap it each time.</p>

<pre><code>if optionalName {
    greeting = ""Hello, "" + optionalName?
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can improve that by using forced unwrapping, since you've already done the test and know that optionalName can never be nil.  This is still inefficient if you reference optionalName multiple times, as each time the unwrapping must be done.</p>

<pre><code>if optionalName {
    greeting = ""Hello, "" + optionalName!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, you can use the if let syntax to test and unwrap all at the same time.  Name is safe to use because it will be of type String, not String?</p>

    greeting = ""Hello, "" + name

","<p>Your second code snippet is functionally equivalent to the one from the book. However, the book suggests using <code>let</code> to avoid multiple unwrapping of the optional value.</p>

<p>Since you are checking <code>optionalName</code> for being empty, it is safe to assume that you plan to use it inside the conditional block. When you do so, Swift would need to unwrap the optional value from <code>optionalName</code> again, because the variable remains optional.</p>

<p>When you do the assignment of <code>optionalName</code> to <code>name</code> in the <code>let</code> declaration, the <code>name</code> constant that you get back is <em>not</em> optional. This saves you the unwrap inside the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Using this code, I was able to connect the bar button to the function by control-dragging from the bar button to the exit icon, and then clicking the unwindToSegue method.  That part has worked, but the code doesn't run, even when I put a breakpoint inside the function it wasn't called.</p>
","<p>I had the same issue. the unwind function was showing when I selected the exit button and it was connecting and all, but when taping the button, nothing happened.</p>

<p>After some messing around I realized that it was due to the Segue I had selected to transit from one View Controller to the other.</p>

<p>The problem turns out was that the view I wanted it to return to had more than a few different navigation components, which upon displaying the ""child"" view got removed. I solved it by changing it from Show (or show detail) to popover.</p>

<p>Go to the segue, select the Attribute Inspector and from there you can change the segue.</p>

677,24960900,0,8,swift,Unwind Segue in Xcode 6 Beta 4,"<p>I've been trying to add an unwind segue to a swift app in Xcode 6, and, in the release notes for the first three betas, it was declared to be unsupported.  However, in Beta 4, that bug note is no longer present.  I have heard that people have been able to get it to work, but I have had no such luck.  So, my question is this:  how should I try to see if the unwind segue will work in my app?  What should I try?  I am using a UIBarButtonItem to trigger the segue.</p>

<p>So far, I've put this code in the destination controller's .swift file:</p>

<pre><code>@IBAction func unwindToSegue(segue:UIStoryboardSegue) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Using this code, I was able to connect the bar button to the function by control-dragging from the bar button to the exit icon, and then clicking the unwindToSegue method.  That part has worked, but the code doesn't run, even when I put a breakpoint inside the function it wasn't called.</p>
","<p>With XCode 6 Beta 4 it works. Remove the @objc(classname) from the class definition and delete the (workaround) .h file.</p>

<p>I had a similar effect yesterday, one of my buttons in my Viewcontroller didn't trigger the unwind segue.</p>

<p>Try that:
Drop a new UIButton on your view controller and leave it as it is. Don't change anything just to make sure that there are no side-effects. Then connect this button to your unwind segue and try if it works.</p>

896,25486200,6,8,swift,Variables of type void,"<p>So I know that <code>Void</code> is used to indicate that a function doesn't take or return a value.
In Swift, <code>Void</code> is actually a type alias for the empty tuple <code>()</code>.</p>

<p>Interestingly (in Beta 6), you can even declare variables of type <code>Void</code>: </p>

<pre><code>var x: Void
println(x)
x = test()

func test() {}
</code></pre>

<p>These statements are all legal. The <code>println()</code> prints ""()"".</p>

<p>So far I couldn't figure out what else this can be used for. Why would you need a variable that can't hold any value? Does anyone know a practical use for this, or is this just one of the quirks of Swift?</p>
","<p><em>Note: This is a crosspost of <a href=""https://devforums.apple.com/message/1031419#1031419"" rel=""nofollow"">my reply</a> on the cross-posted question in the Apple Dev Forums.</em></p>

<p>It's because Swift seems to be a little academically favourable (it's one of Swift's plus points for me! :-) ).</p>

<p>A mathematical function is a relation between some inputs (the arguments) and some outputs (the return values). Instead of defining a whole class (e.g. ""subroutine"" or ""procedure"") for which this doesn't apply (no output, specifically), Swift simply defines a ""procedure"" as a relation with some set of inputs (possibly empty) and an empty set of outputs.</p>

<p>There are some benefits to it, though, albeit uncommon (at least until functional programming becomes the more dominant style in the language and the community). A little example:</p>

<pre><code>infix operator ~~ { precedence 10 associativity right }
func ~~(l: A -&gt; B, r: A) -&gt; B {
     return l(r)
}

let productsSoldIn2014 = productOfSales ~~ salesInYears ~~ [2014]
let salespersonsInvolvedIn2014Sales = salespersonsOfSales ~~ salesInYears ~~ [2014]

fireSalespersons ~~ salespersonsOfSales ~~ salesInYears ~~ [2014]   // Awful companies only.

func salesInYears(_ y: [Int]) -&gt; [Sale] { â¦ }
func productsOfSales(_ s: [Sale]) -&gt; [Product] { â¦ }
func salespersonsOfSales(_ s: [Sale]) -&gt; [SalesPerson] { â¦ }
func fireSalespersons(_ s: [SalesPerson]) -&gt; () { â¦ }               // The appended arrow and null tuple can be left out.
</code></pre>

<p>I've defined a ""chaining"" operator <code>~~</code> (think of a bending chain) which, right to left, pushes a value through the chain. With some appropriately named functions, we can declaratively define the values we need. (With lazy collections instead of arrays, we approach Haskell paradigms. Unless I'm mistaken, <code>~~</code> is here an identity <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">monad</a>. Or it's just a composition operator.)</p>

<p>The third statement (after the two lets) fires the salespersons that sold anything in the year 2014. Note though that <code>~~</code> wants to return ""fireSalespersons""'s value (to continue the chain on the left, which here isn't present), which in Swift is validâit's just the null tuple and we discard it. There's no reason why functions without return value shouldn't work with the operator (without overloading it).</p>

<p>By the way, this is also valid:</p>

<pre><code>increaseCEOBonus(35000) ~~ fireSalespersons ~~ salespersonsOfSales ~~ salesInYears ~~ [2014]      // Really awful companies only.
//         () -&gt; ()  ~~  [Salesperson] -&gt; ()  ~~  [Sales] -&gt; [Salesperson] â¦

func increaseCEOBonus(amount: Int)() { â¦ }
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the leftmost chain is value-lessâit's still left <em>after</em> right, but there aren't any values passed to the left. I wouldn't recommend this use though, it's better to simply enumerate each of them on a separate line.</p>

<p>To return to your question, since ""nothing"" can be consumed (via arguments), it'd be silly to explicitly prohibit ""nothing"" to be assigned to a variableâarguments are variables.</p>

<p>P.S.: Before anybody asks: yes, I did want to have an excuse to make a contrived example; it was just to test my ability to write complex types.</p>

    var sum = 0.0; //now implicitly a double

<p>Integer and Floating-Point Conversion</p>

<p>Conversions between integer and floating-point numeric types must be made explicit:</p>

<pre><code>let three = 3
let pointOneFourOneFiveNine = 0.14159
let pi = Double(three) + pointOneFourOneFiveNine
// pi equals 3.14159, and is inferred to be of type Double
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the value of the constant three is used to create a new value of type Double, so that both sides of the addition are of the same type. Without this conversion in place, the addition would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The reverse is also true for floating-point to integer conversion, in that an integer type can be initialized with a Double or Float value:</p>

<pre><code>let integerPi = Int(pi)
// integerPi equals 3, and is inferred to be of type Int
</code></pre>

<p>Floating-point values are always truncated when used to initialize a new integer value in this way. This means that 4.75 becomes 4, and -3.9 becomes -3.</p>

<p>They say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When to Use Assertions</p>
  
  <p>Use an assertion whenever a condition has the potential to be false,
  but must definitely be true in order for your code to continue
  execution. Suitable scenarios for an assertion check include:</p>
  
  <p>An integer subscript index is passed to a custom subscript
  implementation, but the subscript index value could be too low or too
  high. A value is passed to a function, but an invalid value means that
  the function cannot fulfill its task. An optional value is currently
  nil, but a non-nil value is essential for subsequent code to execute
  successfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds <strong>exactly</strong> like your situation!</p>

<p>Thus your code should look like:</p>

<pre><code>init (timeInterval: Int) {
    assert (timeInterval &gt; 0, ""Time Interval Must be a positive integer"")

    // Continue your execution normally
}

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>In swift, you can't really abort a task half way through execution. There are no exceptions in swift and in general the philosophy is that aborting a task is dangerous and leads to bugs, so it just should't be done.</p>

<p>So, you verify a value like this:</p>

<pre><code>assert(timeInterval &gt; 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which will terminate the program if an invalid value is provided.</p>

<p>You should also change <code>timeInterval</code> to be a <code>UInt</code> so that there will be a compiler error if anybody tries to give a <code>&lt; 0</code> value or an integer value that could be &lt; 0.</p>

<p>It's probably not the answer you're looking for. But the goal is to check for bad parameters as early as possible, and that means doing it <em>before</em> you create any objects with those parameters. Ideally the check should be done at compile time but that doesn't always work.</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }

    func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return 10
    }


    func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; UITableViewCell! {
        let cell: UITableViewCell = UITableViewCell(style: UITableViewCellStyle.Subtitle, reuseIdentifier: ""MyTestCell"")

        cell.text = ""Row #\(indexPath.row)""
        cell.detailTextLabel.text = ""Subtitle #\(indexPath.row)""

        return cell

922,25545220,4,7,swift,is it possible to create a generic closure in Swift?,"<pre><code>func myfunc&lt;T&gt;(i:T) -&gt; T {

<p>is it possible to make this generic function a closure?</p>

<pre><code>let myfunc = { &lt;T&gt;(i:T) -&gt; T in
    return i
}
</code></pre>

<p>this doesn't work...</p>
","<p>No, because variables and expressions can't be generic. There are only generic functions and generic types.</p>

<hr>

<p>To clarify: In some languages you can have types with a universal quantifier, like <code>forall a. a -&gt; a</code>. But in Swift, types cannot have a universal quantifier. So expressions and values cannot be themselves generic. Function declarations and type declarations can be generic, but when you use such a generic function or an instance of such a generic type, some type (which could be a real type or a type variable) is chosen as the type argument, and thereafter the value you get is no longer itself generic.</p>

971,25693730,2,7,swift,iOS 8 custom keyboard crash when debugging,"<p><strong>Issue</strong> </p>

<p>Most times, when I try to debug my custom keyboard extension, I receive the following error and then the keyboard disappears (presumably crashes, so the system removes it from screen and replaces it with the standard keyboard) </p>

<pre><code> plugin com.db.Trype.TrypeKeyboard interrupted
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: <code>Trype</code> is the name of my keyboard.)</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>

<p>I am debugging the keyboard the following way: </p>

<ul>
<li>I have the keyboard extension as a target. </li>
<li>I've modified the <code>TrypeKeyboard</code> scheme to run my app executable on launch. </li>
<li>The keyboard has been added in the Simulator's Settings App. </li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried different version of Xcode-Beta and tried restarting the simulator, computer, etc., all to a <strong>varying degree of temporary success.</strong> </p>

<p>Anyone else run into this error and have a suggestion?</p>

<p>Update:
Here is an accompanying error message. Maybe there is some way to print out more of the UserInfo?</p>

<pre><code> viewServiceDidTerminateWithError:: Error Domain=_UIViewServiceInterfaceErrorDomain Code=3

","<p>After messing around with it some more, I'm beginning to conclude this is an iOS 8/Xcode bug with the way that extensions are debugged. </p>

<p>Xcode sometimes seems to build project and install <em>multiple</em> versions of the extension keyboard into the iOS simulator. It also occasionally kills the extension and reloads it. Very strange behavior. Just sitting and staring at the debugging sidebar shows it get killed (disappear) and then relaunch.</p>

<p>The first is a successful launch.
The second is an <em>unsuccessful</em> launch where the extension appears to hang and wait to attach.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>As indicated in the first line of your dump, you're trying to send <code>...numberOfRows...</code> to an object of class <code>UIViewController</code> but that method is only implemented in your subclass.</p>

<p>In your nib file you need to change the class of your view controller from <code>UIViewController</code> (the default) to <code>ViewController</code>.</p>

<p>Open your storyboard (or nib file) select the controller itself (it has an icon at the bottom (or top in Xcode 6) that will say ""View Controller"" when you mouse over it.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qkl2z.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then select the 3rd icon from the properties panel and up at the top where it says ""Custom Class"" enter ""ViewController""</p>

","<p>It appears that your table's data source is not set to your ViewController class:</p>

<pre><code> -[UIViewController tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xb20fcf0
</code></pre>

<p>I was just wondering if the new deinit() in Swift would be a good choice?</p>

<p>-nick</p>
","<p>It really depends on the role of the class where you subscribe to NSNotificationCenter notifications. If you are subscribing in:</p>

<p><strong>UIView</strong></p>

<p>Then you should unsubscribe as soon as view gets invisible to the user. To save CPU cycles and not consume resources while user does not see the view.</p>

<p><strong>UIViewController</strong></p>

<p>Here it also depends on kind of action that you are going to perform in response to notification. If it is just a UI adjustment that you should unsubscribe as soon as view controller disappears from the screen. </p>

<p><strong>You App Service layer</strong></p>

<p>Here it is OK to have <code>.removeObserver</code> inside deinit(). however even here I tend to suggest you to be more explicit about when you subscribe and unsubscribe from <code>NSNotificationCenter</code>notifications and put them in start and stop methods of your service.</p>

448,24350000,7,7,swift,Keywords with and without @ in Swift,"<p>In Swift, sometimes, keywords are plain keywords, and some others start with an <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>weak</code>, <code>unowned</code>, <code>inout</code>, <code>class</code> are plain. But <code>@final</code>, <code>@lazy</code> start with <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we even have both! <code>prefix</code> and <code>@prefix</code>, <code>infix</code> and <code>@infix</code> for instance.</p>

<p>It is not entirely an Objective-C inheritance since we have <code>@class</code> and not <code>class</code> in Objective-C. I could understand why we have <code>class</code> and not <code>@class</code> in Swift, but since we have <code>@final</code> or <code>@lazy</code> , I would have thought that it should be <code>@weak</code> and not <code>weak</code>.</p>

<p>Why this choice? Is there a kind of intuitive way that should tell: ""hey, it is logical that this keyword starts with <code>@</code>?</p>

<p>Even if I think with a preprocessor perspective in mind, it is not obvious that <code>@</code> would call a kind of specific preprocessor before compilation (e.g. <code>@final</code> is not really a kind of preprocessor directive).</p>
","<p><code>@</code>-prefixed items in Swift are not <em>keywords</em>, these are <em>attributes</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some attributes (such as <code>@objc(isEnabled)</code>) accept parameters.</p>

<p>The main difference between attributes and keywords is that keywords tell the compiler what you are defining (a class, a method, a property, a variable, and so on), while attributes tell the compiler in what contexts you intend to use that definition. For example, you would use a <code>func</code> keyword to tell the compiler that you are defining a function, and decorate that function with an <code>@infix</code> attribute to tell the compiler that you plan to use that function as an infix operator.</p>

<p>I have seen this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24103169/swift-compiler-error-non-modular-header-inside-framework-module"">answer</a> that discusses making the relevant header files public. I have done that but I am not sure how to address the case of this header that is imported in the DDXMLNode.h and that is not explicitly part of my project:</p>

<p><code>#import &lt;libxml/tree.h&gt;</code></p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to handle this?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have used KissXML on a Objective-C only project and it worked fine (Xcode 5).</p>
","<p>The trick is to create a <strong>module</strong> and include it on your project.</p>

<p>To create the module you create a file named, let's say, <strong>module.modulemap</strong> which exports the API on the header files of interest like this:</p>

<pre><code>module libxmlModuleDevice {
    header ""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/usr/include/libxml2/libxml/tree.h""
    export *
}

module libxmlModuleSimulator {
    header ""/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/usr/include/libxml2/libxml/tree.h""
    export *
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that you need to do this both for the simulator and for the actual device - hence the 2 entries on the file.</p>

<p>This file <strong>module.modulemap</strong> can be placed anywhere. I created a directory called <strong>modules</strong> at the same level as the Xcode's project file (.xcodeproj) and placed the <strong>module.modulemap</strong> file there.</p>

<p>Then add directory that contains this file to the <strong>Header Search Path</strong> under <strong>Build Settings</strong> of you Xcode project. </p>

<p>In this example all you have to do is to add the word <strong>modules</strong> to the <strong>Header Search Path</strong> because the <strong>modules</strong> directory is at the same level as the Xcode project file. This will update internally the Xcode project variable <strong>HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS</strong>. That's it.</p>

","<p><strong>First, a note:</strong> Your names for view controllers should include ""ViewController"" in the name. There is an entirely different collection of classes that inherit from <code>UIView</code>. Naming a View Controller just <code>ViewA</code> makes it look like your class is just a view instead of a view controller. Views are in an entirely different layer of your application.</p>

<p><strong>Now, to pass data to another object</strong>, your first requirement is to have a reference between them. This reference can be setup in either direction.</p>

<p>One possibility is to have ViewControllerA keep a reference to ViewControllerB. Through this reference, ViewControllerA can call a method on ViewControllerB when the button is pressed which takes that data you want to pass as an argument.</p>

<pre><code>class ViewControllerA: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var viewControllerB: ViewControllerB!

    @IBAction func addButton(sender: AnyObject) {
        self.viewControllerB.showNameLabel(textField.text)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other possibility, is to use a delegate pattern like your title suggests. This would involve ViewControllerB having a reference to ViewControllerA. Preferably, this would not be with direct knowledge of the ViewControllerA class, but instead through a protocol. The protocol would define a method that <strong>returns</strong> the data you want to ""pass"" to ViewControllerB. That way, ViewContollerB can call the protocol method on its ""delegate"" (which would happen to be ViewControllerA) to get the data it needs.</p>

<pre><code>protocol ViewControllerBDelegate {
    func requiredText() -&gt; String
}

class ViewControllerB: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var delegate: ViewControllerBDelegate?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        if let actualDelegate = self.delegate {
            self.theLabel.text = actualDelegate.requiredText()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which method you choose really depends on what you need in this circumstance. The delegate pattern is better to keep your objects less coupled together, but if you are already needing to ""trigger"" things to happen on ViewControllerB from ViewControllerA then the more direct method is probably required.</p>

My custom TreeNode will collide with Standard Library's TreeNode... Will I have to change all my code in cases like that? Or maybe Apple will promise that Swift's Standard Library will not change in the future?</p>

<p>EDIT: Question answered <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24293236/3463265"">here</a> (thanks @Martin R for your comment)</p>
","<p>Namespacing in Swift is implicit. All classes and other symbols belong to the target (module) they are defined in. So if you define a class <code>String</code> the fully qualified name would be <code>MyTarget.String</code>. When there is a name collision, you have to prefix the class name with the module (framework) it is defined in, except when there is a class with that name defined in the current module - this class takes precedence and does not need to be prefixed.</p>

<pre><code>struct String {
    var swiftString = """"
}

var a = String()
var b = Swift.String()
</code></pre>

<p>So if you create your class <code>TreeNode</code> and Apple later adds a <code>TreeNode</code> as well, your name would take precedence if you are using only one module and you wouldn't need to change anything. If you would want to use Swift's <code>TreeNode</code>, you would need to refer to it as <code>Swift.TreeNode</code>.</p>

Thank you for any help!</p>
","<p>The fact that it's a linker error should point you into the right direction. Compilation errors usually mean an error in your syntax. Linker error means that although your source files have been compiled correctly, but when the time comes to be linked with other frameworks (system frameworks, or 3rd party ones), clang cannot find them in place.</p>

<p>Usually, this is because a 3rd party library is missing from your system, and your project depends on it, and although it can find the header files, it cannot find the actual library file to connect to. The fact that transferring your project to other computers is giving you problems, while at your computer compiles and links correctly also strengthens the assumption that probably it's a problem with the environment you are trying to compile with and you need to install something.</p>

<p>To find out more about the issue, go into Xcode, go into the report navigator, and you will see logs of all the builds you have made. Check the first one (which is the last build). Scroll to the bottom, and see exactly why it didn't compile. The most common scenario is that some symbol could not be found. Check in which library this symbol belongs, then install this library to your system.</p>

<p>This is just wrong, even in Objective-C.</p>

<p>The <code>BOOL</code>/<code>NSError</code> pattern in Cocoa dictates that you have to check the <code>success</code> value to know whether an error occured, and - if that's the case - then the <code>NSError</code> will contain information about it.</p>

<p>Can you point me to an example of implementing an update method for SceneKit?  Thanks.</p>
","<p>(Yes, I know this question is about <strong>SceneKit</strong>, not SpriteKit, but it touches on the commonalities and differences between the two frameworks, so I'll address those in this answer.)</p>

<p>In SpriteKit, the game-loop methods (<code>update</code>, <code>didSimulatePhysics</code>, etc) were originally part of the scene class <code>SKScene</code>. This isn't always the best idea, though â you might want to treat a scene instance more like data than like a place to implement game logic (especially now that scenes can be built completely in the Xcode 6 graphical scene editor).  So in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, those methods are in two places. If you're already subclassing <code>SKScene</code> for per-frame game logic, you can keep doing that. But if you'd rather put that code elsewhere, you can set a delegate on your scene, and implement the equivalent <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SKSceneDelegate_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014319""><code>SKSceneDelegate</code></a> methods there.</p>

<p>SceneKit has more of a separation of concerns. An <code>SCNScene</code> is much closer to being a pure data-model object, and all rendering-loop functionality managed by the view (or other object) responsible for displaying the scene. Typically you display a scene in an <code>SCNView</code> â but there are other classes that can render scenes, too, so their common API is found in the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SCNSceneRenderer_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012016""><code>SCNSceneRenderer</code></a> protocol. Use the <code>delegate</code> property defined by that protocol to set a delegate for your view, and in your delegate you can implement <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SCNSceneRendererDelegate_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012017""><code>SCNSceneRendererDelegate</code></a> methods to participate in key phases of the render loop. </p>

<p>The SceneKit loop phases correspond almost directly to those in SpriteKit: <code>update:</code> becomes <code>renderer:updateAtTime:</code>, <code>didEvaluateActions:</code> becomes <code>renderer:didApplyAnimationsAtTime:</code> (because it includes CoreAnimation-style animations as well as SpriteKit-style actions), etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, for the SceneKit equivalent of the SpriteKit per-frame <code>update</code> method, do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set one of your custom objects (say, a view controller) as the <code>delegate</code> of your <code>SCNView</code> instance.</p></li>
<li><p>In that custom class, implement the following method:</p>

<pre><code>func renderer(_ aRenderer: SCNSceneRenderer!, updateAtTime time: NSTimeInterval) {
    // per-frame code here
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Or do similar for the other <code>SCNSceneRendererDelegate</code> methods if your per-frame logic needs to happen after actions or physics have been processed.</p>

<p>We compared ARC/deletion of objection in an app scenario and within the Playground. Our test code used object created inside and outside a particular scope. We also nested the tester object to test multi-nested scoping. </p>

<p>We saw that the app scenario deletes objects right on cue (zeroth reference) whereas the Playground scenario deletes a few, but holds on to a <em>majority</em> of objects (irrespective of scope, but apparently consistent over multiple runs). </p>

","<p>You can't define an anonymous class, but you can define a local class that works very similarly.  I've actually migrated away from the inline class approach as the REPL seems to have problems with it even though it seems to be fine with the compiler.  The approach I'm now using is to define a glue class which forwards methods to closures defined in the init, so it all feels very natural.</p>

<p>The URLConnectionDataDelegate is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>class GreenUrlConnectionDataDelegate: NSObject, NSURLConnectionDataDelegate {
    var didFinishLoading:()-&gt;()
    var didReceiveResponse:((NSURLResponse!)-&gt;())?
    var didReceiveData:((NSData!)-&gt;())?
    var didFailWithError:((NSError!)-&gt;())?

    func connectionDidFinishLoading(conn:NSURLConnection!) {
        didFinishLoading()
    }

    func connection(conn:NSURLConnection!, didReceiveResponse response:NSURLResponse!) {
        didReceiveResponse?(response)
    }

    func connection(conn:NSURLConnection!, didReceiveData data:NSData!) {
        didReceiveData?(data)
    }

    func connection(conn:NSURLConnection!, didFailWithError error:NSError!) {
        didFailWithError?(error)
    }

    init(
        didFinishLoading:()-&gt;(),
        didReceiveResponse:((NSURLResponse!)-&gt;())? = nil,
        didReceiveData:((NSData!)-&gt;())? = nil,
        didFailWithError:((NSError!)-&gt;())? = nil
    ) {
        self.didFinishLoading = didFinishLoading
        self.didReceiveResponse = didReceiveResponse
        self.didReceiveData = didReceiveData
        self.didFailWithError = didFailWithError
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which allows me to define a function with an inline delegate:</p>

<pre><code>func downloadUrl(string:String, completion:(data:NSData?, error:NSError?) -&gt; ()) {
    let url = NSURL(string:string)
    let request = NSURLRequest(URL: url)
    var received:NSMutableData! = nil
    let conn = NSURLConnection(request: request, delegate: GreenUrlConnectionDataDelegate(
            didFinishLoading:{
                completion(data:received, error:nil)
            },
            didReceiveResponse:{
                if let capacity = $0?.expectedContentLength {
                    if capacity &gt; 0 {
                        received = NSMutableData(capacity: Int(capacity))
                    }
                    else {
                        received = NSMutableData()
                    }
                }
            },
            didReceiveData:{
                if $0 != nil {
                    received.appendData($0)
                }
            },
            didFailWithError:{
                completion(data:nil, error:$0)
            }
        )
    )
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the code to test it out in a playground:</p>

<pre><code>downloadUrl(""http://www.google.com"") {
    (data:NSData?, error:NSError?) -&gt; () in
    println(""completion"")
    println(""data.size: \(data?.length)"")
    println(""error: \(error?.localizedDescription)"")
}

XCPSetExecutionShouldContinueIndefinitely()

470,24416860,0,6,swift,What is wrong with the implementation of NSCoding protocol in Swift,"<p>I thought I'd be cautious and try out Swift on an existing Obj-C project by converting one class. And a small, simple one at that. Oh dear.</p>

<p>Transliterating the original obj-c into Swift should be straightforward and so it seemed. Unfortunately, whilst the encoder to persistent store seems to work, it crashes with an EXC_BREAKPOINT error at the first line of the init coder.</p>

<p>IF (and the caps are intentional) NSCoding/Swift gives the same persistent content as NSCoding/ObjC, then my all obj-c version should be able to read what is encoded by Swift and vice versa. This proves not to be the case - and my perfectly-functioning obj-c version crashes out when it tries to read the persistent store from the Swift version. Surely, if NSCoding is implemented correctly, it ought to generate something in one that is readable in t'other? Otherwise, there ought to be separate NSCodingSwift and NSCodingObjC protocols?</p>

<p>So, to summarise, I can read/write in obj-c. I can't write/obj-c and read/swift and I can write/swift read/obj-c and I can't read/write in swift.</p>

","<p>The only thing that stands out to me is that you're using <code>String</code> instead of <code>NSString</code> as the <code>name</code>'s type. In the betas Apple has been putting out, <code>String</code> (strangely) is not a one-for-one replacement of <code>NSString</code>. Namely, some methods are missing and require calling <code>.bridgeToObjectiveC()</code> to get the <code>NSString</code> version. Using that type instead will probably conform to what <code>NSCoder</code> is expecting, though that difference should not be so. </p>

<p>I didn't actually test this claim since I'm not on my dev machine. But that's my gut instinct. Try it and see what happens! If nothing changes, try switching the order of how you're setting the vars and see if it's a problem related to the <code>name</code> field or simply the first line of the init function.</p>

198,24066270,2,6,swift,Can't hook up an outlet collection in Xcode 6 using storyboard,"<p>I am having trouble creating an outlet collection in Xcode 6. Outlet collections in Xcode 6 now function as regular IBOutlets, and you use the same @IBOutlet attribute to declare an outlet collection while being sure to specify an array for the type. I have done this in my view controller's swift file i.e.</p>

<pre><code>@IBOutlet var cardButtons: UIButton[]
</code></pre>

<p>In Xcode 5 when one control drags from an element in the storyboard to the corresponding view controller using the assistant editor they are presented with an option to create either an outlet or an outlet collection. This seems to no longer be possible in Xcode 6 and my guess is because outlets and outlet collection now share the same @IBOutlet attribute. How should I create an outlet collection which will contain say 10 buttons without being able to control drag each one from the storyboard view and hook it up to my</p>

","<p>I believe that in Swift you <strong><em>generally</strong> cannot call functions before they have been declared</em>, as they are <em>unknown to the compiler at that time</em>. In Objective C this was different because declaring the function in the header introduced it to the compiler at import time as a pointer to the function definition. Then, when the function was called the compiler could reference the imported pointer which would then take it to the function definition in the file. <br> In Swift, this is different because we are not required to declare our properties in a header file - we simultaneously declare and define in one file. While simpler, this creates a problem resembling yours, where the compiler is unaware of the function until its declaration/definition. <br> In classes, the rules are changed because we can call functions like this: <br> </p>

<pre><code>    class HypnosisViewController: UIViewController {

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            // Function call
            addValues(30.0, 40.0) 
        } 

        // Function declaration
        func addValues(valueA:Double, valueB:Double){
            let result = valueB + valueB
            println(""Result \(result)"")
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>even though the function isn't declared until after the function call. We can do this because when an instance of a class is created, <em>all of the instance variables and methods of that class are <strong>initialized</strong> to that object</em>. This means the compiler has already initialized - and therefore recognized - the addValues function, so it doesn't complain. <br> However, when code is executed linearly, such as in Playground, we do not have this initialization so it is not possible to call a function before it's declaration for the reasons previously stated (the compiler is unaware of the function). Playground's atypical behavior with this kind of situation is a little more ambiguous to me, because it complains about the function call preceding the function declaration however it still shows the result of the call to the right. I believe this is due to the unique way that Playground compiles its code. <br> I apologize because I am unaware of a technique to retain this Objective C functionality in Swift, which I know was part of your question. However I hope this gave you some background as to why this is happening.</p>

}  

let obj = Class()
</code></pre>

<p>Now how swift initialiser returns the instance to variable <code>obj</code>?. </p>

<p>How the <em><strong>allocation and initialisation</strong></em> occurs in swift?</p>
","<p>It's just a convention. Swift initialiser sets up a valid instance and could not theoretically return anything other that a valid instance, so there's no point in explicit return.</p>

<p>So (from my point of view) allocation &amp; initialisation sequence looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Runtime allocates instance of requested class</li>
<li>Initializer is called with <code>self</code> set to allocated instance</li>
<li>Initializer performs setup</li>
<li>Runtime returns initialised instance to client code</li>
</ol>

<p>Although this approach breaks some useful Objective-C patterns like initialisers returning <code>nil</code> on error, the guarantee that instantiation always succeeds allows compiler to perform some optimisations. Also without dropping initialisers returning <code>nil</code> it would be impossible to actually remove <code>nil</code> from language, it would seem weird if initialisers were returning optionals.</p>

<pre><code>    var x = CGFloat(0.5)

    var result: CGFloat

    #if arch(x86_64) || arch(arm64)
        result = ceil(x)
    #else
        result = ceilf(x)
    #endif

    // use result
</code></pre>

<p>(Background info for those already confused: CGFloat is a ""float"" type for 32-bit architecture, ""double"" for 64-bit architecture (i.e. the compilation target), which is why just using either of <code>ceil()</code> or <code>ceilf()</code> on it won't always compile, depending on the target architecture. And note that you don't seem to be able to use <code>CGFLOAT_IS_DOUBLE</code> for conditional compilation, only the architecture flags...)</p>

<p>Now, that's attracted some debate in the comments about fixing things at compile time versus run time, and so forth. My answer was accepted too fast to attract what might be some good debate about this, I think.</p>

<p>So, my new question: is the above a safe, and sensible thing to do, if you want your iOS and OS X code to run on 32- and 64-bit devices? And if it <em>is</em> sane and sensible, is there still a better (at least as efficient, not as ""icky"") solution?</p>
","<p><em>Note that with current version of Swift the solution below is already implemented in the standard library and all mathematical functions are properly overloaded for <code>Double</code>, <code>Float</code> and <code>CGFloat</code>.</em></p>

<p><code>Ceil</code> is an arithmetic operation and in the same way as any other arithmetic operation, there should be an overloaded version for both <code>Double</code> and <code>Float</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var f1: Float = 1.0
var f2: Float = 2.0

var d1: Double = 1.0
var d2: Double = 2.0

var f = f1 + f2
var d = d1 + d2
</code></pre>

<p>This works because <code>+</code> is overloaded and works for both types.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, by pulling the math functions from the C library which doesn't support function overloading, we are left with two functions instead of one - <code>ceil</code> and <code>ceilf</code>.</p>

<p>I think the best solution is to overload <code>ceil</code> for <code>Float</code> types:</p>

<pre><code>func ceil(f: CFloat) -&gt; CFloat {
    return ceilf(f)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Allowing us to do:</p>

<pre><code>var f: Float = 0.5
var d: Double = 0.5

var f: Float = ceil(f)
var d: Double = ceil(d)
</code></pre>

<p>Once we have the same operations defined for both <code>Float</code> and <code>Double</code>, even <code>CGFloat</code> handling will be much simpler.</p>

<p><b>To answer the comment:</b></p>

<p>Depending on target processor architecture, <code>CGFloat</code> can be defined either as <code>Float</code> or a <code>Double</code>. That means we should use <code>ceil</code> or <code>ceilf</code> depending on target architecture.</p>

<pre><code>var cgFloat: CGFloat = 1.5

//on 64bit it's a Double
var rounded: CGFloat = ceil(cgFloat)

//on 32bit it's a Float
var rounded: CGFloat = ceilf(cgFloat)
</code></pre>

<p>However, we would have to use the ugly <code>#if</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is to use clever casts</p>

<pre><code>var cgFloat: CGFloat = 1.5
var rounded: CGFloat = CGFloat(ceil(Double(cgFloat))
</code></pre>

<p>(casting first to <code>Double</code>, then casting the result to <code>CGFloat</code>)</p>

<p>However, when we are working with numbers, we want math functions to be transparent.</p>

<pre><code>var cgFloat1: CGFloat = 1.5
var cgFloat2: CGFloat = 2.5

// this works on both 32 and 64bit architectures!
var sum: CGFloat = cgFloat1 + cgFloat 2
</code></pre>

<p>If we overload <code>ceil</code> for <code>Float</code> as shown above, we are able to do</p>

<pre><code>var cgFloat: CGFloat = 1.5

<p>Building on your solution, and if you use it in several places, then a little extension might make it more palatable:</p>

<pre><code>extension CGFloat {
    var ceil: CGFloat {
        #if arch(x86_64) || arch(arm64)
            return ceil(x)

        #endif

x.ceil

580,24703520,2,5,swift,Implementing SWRevealViewController in Swift,"<p>I am using the 'plugin' SWRevealViewController to help produce a sidebar in my app. Now in objective-C, you can control the side bar using the following code:</p>

        [self.view addGestureRecognizer:self.revealViewController.panGestureRecognizer];

<pre><code>button = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .Add, target: self.revealViewController(), action: ""revealToggle:"")

<p>However, this does nothing and the button doesn't function. However, if I set button to be a UIButton and hook this up with the following:</p>

<pre><code>button.addTarget(self.revealViewController(), action:""revealToggle:"", forControlEvents:UIControlEvents.TouchUpInside)
</code></pre>

<p>This works to slide the bar out and in but not via gestures. The issue is that I can't add a UIButton to the toolbar (in StoryBoard anyway).</p>

<p>So is there any way to implement this properly? <strong>Additionally, is it possible to add the gesture recogniser as well?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>var swipeRight = UISwipeGestureRecognizer(target: self.revealViewController(), action: ""revealToggle:"")
    swipeRight.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection.Right
    self.view.addGestureRecognizer(swipeRight)

    var swipeLeft = UISwipeGestureRecognizer(target: self.revealViewController(), action: ""revealToggle:"")
    swipeLeft.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection.Left
    self.view.addGestureRecognizer(swipeLeft)

","<p><a href=""http://blog.human-friendly.com/swift-arrays-the-bugs-the-bad-and-the-ugly-incomplete"" rel=""nofollow"">Your ""<code>getList</code>"" function is returning an immutable <em>copy</em> of the list array</a>, which is why you can't modify via an array retrieved via the <code>getList()</code> function.</p>

<p>But you can modify the original array when you access the member variable, as you've discovered in your ""<code>OK</code>"" case.  </p>

<p>Basically you'll probably either need to append on the original ""<code>list</code>"" array, or write an ""<code>append</code>"" func for your ""<code>User</code>"" class.</p>

","<p>That is a bug; I find it surprising that it compiles without an error or warning. (I guess it's probably being turned into a call to isEqual:, passing nil?) Interestingly, the more idiomatic version:</p>

<pre><code> #define CMTIME_IS_VALID(time) ((Boolean)(((time).flags &amp; kCMTimeFlags_Valid) != 0))

","<p>You can define a custom extension with a read-only computed property <code>isValid</code>:</p>

","<p>This is one of Swift's many cryptic error messages. As far as I can tell because the left side and right side don't match (<code>Optional&lt;String&gt;</code> vs <code>String</code>), its best guess is that you meant for both sides to be <code>UInt8</code>.</p>

<p>To get over the fact that <code>UILabel.text</code> is optional, you can do things the long way:</p>

<pre><code>actionLabel.text = (actionLabel.text ?? """") + ""\(action.name) |""
</code></pre>

<p>This gets the current value or a blank string and appends the text. You could also avoid the problem functionally:</p>

<pre><code>actionLabel.text = join("" | "", map(actions, { $0.name }))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>With regards to iterative solution having an extra <code>|</code> at the end in the """", I was trying to illustrate the solution to just the line causing the error.  Your posted code also makes assumptions about actionLabel having been initially blank and has some (likely insignificant) performance costs of setting label text multiple times.</p>

<p>A complete iterative approach could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var text = """"
for action in actions {
    if text.isEmpty {
        text = action.name
    } else {
        text += "" | \(action.name)""
    }
}
actionLabel.text = text
</code></pre>

<p>Mapping and joining are such common operations that most languages have clean succinct ways of doing it without iteration.  For example, I would recommend the following in Objective-C:</p>

<pre><code>actionLabel.text = [[actions valueForKeyPath:@""name""] componentsJoinedByString:@"" | ""];

495,24461520,7,4,swift,Swift cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type 'String!',"<p>I'm trying to use a piece of sample code from <a href=""http://nshipster.com/ios8/"" rel=""nofollow"">this NSHipster article</a>, about halfway down the page.</p>

<pre><code>var inputStream: NSInputStream
var outputStream: NSOutputStream

NSStream.getStreamsToHostWithName(hostname: ""nshipster.com"",
                                      port: 5432,
                               inputStream: &amp;inputStream,
                              outputStream: &amp;outputStream)
</code></pre>

<p>I've placed this in a playground, along with <code>import Foundation</code>, and I get this error.</p>

<pre><code>Playground execution failed: error: &lt;REPL&gt;:6:10: error: cannot convert the expression's type 'Void' to type 'String!'
NSStream.getStreamsToHostWithName(hostname: ""nshipster.com"",
~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre>

<p>This error is pointing to the first argument, which is clearly of type <code>String!</code> and not <code>Void</code>.</p>

<p>I changed the code up a bit, to extract the definitions from the method call. Here's the complete playground:</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation

var inputStream: NSInputStream
var outputStream: NSOutputStream

let host = ""nshipster.com""
let port = 5432
NSStream.getStreamsToHostWithName(hostname: host,
    port: port,
    inputStream: &amp;inputStream,
    outputStream: &amp;outputStream)

<p>Now the error indicates the third argument, presumably happy with the first two.</p>

inputStream: &amp;inputStream,
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out how I can extract <code>AutoreleasingUnsafePointer</code> variables for inputStream and outputStream in the same manner, but I think the original sample code should work. Is this a bug in my (and Mattt's) code, or a bug in Swift?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've submitted a <a href=""https://github.com/NSHipster/articles/pull/174"" rel=""nofollow"">pull request</a> with the corrected code for NSHipster.</p>
","<p>Well, the short answer is that you need to be passing in optionals instead of non-optionals (to anything that's looking for inout objects)</p>

<pre><code>var inputStream:NSInputStream?
var outputStream:NSOutputStream?

NSStream.getStreamsToHostWithName(""nshipster.com"", port: 5432, inputStream: &amp;inputStream, outputStream: &amp;outputStream)
</code></pre>

<p>That said, it compiles now, but doesn't run because NSStream apparently doesn't have a getStreamsToHostWithName method (at least in the Foundation I get imported)  Never mind this, it's an iOS-only call, so it didn't work with Playground set to OSX.  Seems to be ok with it set to iOS.</p>

In advance, thanks to those who can help. I have been struggling over this a few days now. </p>

<p>Having trouble building a simple UIImage array.  (I've stripped out all other code for simplicity.)  I'm trying to understand why declaring an UIImage array and loading images works within viewDidLoad(), but not at the ""base"" of ViewController, which is where I seem to need it for other things to work. </p>

If you are planning on doing iOS development, it would be helpful to learn objective-c even if you want to use Swift because you'll gain exposure to Apple's APIs which are the same in both languages.</p>

601,24734200,8,4,swift,Swift - How to change the Pivot of a SCNNode object,"<p>I've been playing with the SCNNode object for a while now and I'm lot with the Pivot. How can I change the pivot of a SCNNode(SCNBox as a bar) and place the pivot on one of the edge of the bar ?</p>
","<p>A node's <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SCNNode_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/SCNNode/pivot""><code>pivot</code></a> is a transformation matrix, the inverse of which is applied to the node before its <code>transform</code> property takes effect. For example, take a look at this bit from the default SceneKit Game template in Xcode:</p>

<pre><code>let boxNode = SCNNode()
boxNode.geometry = SCNBox(width: 1, height: 1, length: 1, chamferRadius: 0.02)
</code></pre>

<p>If you set the <code>boxNode</code>'s <code>position</code>, that point corresponds to the center of the cube, and if you rotate it (as the template does in an animation), it spins around its center.</p>

<p>To change the anchor point, set the <code>pivot</code> to a translation transform:</p>

<pre><code>boxNode.pivot = SCNMatrix4MakeTranslation(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you set the <code>position</code> that point corresponds to the top-right-front corner of the cube, and when you rotate the cube it spins around that corner.</p>

<p>More generally, a pivot transforms the <em>contents</em> of a node relative to the node's own transform. Suppose you wanted to model the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession"">precession</a> of the Earth's axis of rotation. You could do this by creating two animations: one that animates <code>pivot</code> to spin the node around its own Y axis, and another that animates <code>rotation</code> to move that axis relative to the space containing the node.</p>

","<p>If you convert the NSArray into a Swift Array, you can use Swift's Array.filter method. Here's an example with simpler objects for clarity:</p>

<pre><code>let arrObjc: NSArray = [""aaa"", ""bab"", ""bbb"", ""baa"", ""cbc""]
let arr: [AnyObject] = arrObjc //create a swift array with same data

// filter takes a block that returns a boolean. True: keep the item, False: drop it.
arr.filter{
  if let s = $0 as? String {  // first try to cast AnyObject to our expected type.
    return contains(s, ""a"")   // return true if we want this item, false otherwise.
  } else {

770,25162500,0,4,swift,Apple Swift - Generate combinations with repetition,"<p>I'm trying to generate a nested array containing all combinations with repetition in Apple's Swift programming language.</p>

<p>An detailed explanation of combinations with repetition can be found near the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html</a></p>

<p>Briefly; order does not matter, and we can repeat</p>

<p>n = the set of things we are choosing form</p>

<p>r = the number of things we are choosing</p>

<p>I want to create a function that will generate a nested array containing all combinations with repetition for any (small) values of n and r.</p>

<p>If there are n=3 things to choose from, and we choose r=2 of them.</p>

<pre><code>n = [0, 1, 2]
r = 2
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the function <code>combos(n: [0, 1, 2], r: 2)</code> would be:</p>

<pre><code>result = [
  [0, 0],
  [0, 1],  
  [0, 2],
  [1, 1],
  [1, 2],
  [2, 2]
]

// we don't need [1, 0], [2, 0] etc. because ""order does not matter""
</code></pre>

<p>There are examples for doing this in many programming languages here: <a href=""http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Combinations_with_repetitions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Combinations_with_repetitions</a></p>

<p>Here's the PHP example. It is one of the simplest and returns an array, which is what I want:</p>

<pre><code>function combos($arr, $k) {
    if ($k == 0) {
        return array(array());
    }

    if (count($arr) == 0) {
        return array();
    }

    $head = $arr[0];

    $combos = array();
    $subcombos = combos($arr, $k-1);
    foreach ($subcombos as $subcombo) {
        array_unshift($subcombo, $head);
        $combos[] = $subcombo;
    }
    array_shift($arr);
    $combos = array_merge($combos, combos($arr, $k));
    return $combos;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's where I've got so far with porting the function to Swift:</p>

<pre><code>func combos(var array: [Int], k: Int) -&gt; AnyObject { // -&gt; Array&lt;Array&lt;Int&gt;&gt; {
    if k == 0 {
        return [[]]
    }

    if array.isEmpty {
        return []
    }

    let head = array[0]

    var combos = [[]]
    var subcombos: [Array&lt;Int&gt;] = combos(array, k-1)    // error: '(@Ivalue [Int], $T5) -&gt; $T6' is not identical to '[NSArray]'
    for subcombo in subcombos {
        var sub = subcombo
        sub.insert(head, atIndex: 0)
        combos.append(sub)
    }
    array.removeAtIndex(0)
    combos += combos(array, k)    // error: '(@Ivalue [Int], Int) -&gt; $T5' is not identical to '[NSArray]'

    return combos
}
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly I seem to be having problems with the type declarations of the various variables and weather these are mutable or immutable.</p>

<p>I've tried being more explicit and less explicit with the type declarations but all I'm managed to achieve are slightly different error messages.</p>

<p>I would be most grateful if someone would explain where I'm going wrong and why?</p>

<p>Many thanks :-)</p>
","<p>The main mistake I was making was to use a var named the same as my function:</p>

<pre><code>combos += combos(array, k)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is why I was seeing an error on this line and the other line where my function was being called.</p>

<p>After fixing that the rest of the problems were easier to solve :)</p>

<p>In case it will help anyone here's my working function:</p>

<pre><code>func combos&lt;T&gt;(var array: Array&lt;T&gt;, k: Int) -&gt; Array&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    if k == 0 {
        return [[]]
    }

    if array.isEmpty {
        return []
    }

    let head = array[0]

    var ret: Array&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt; = []
    var subcombos = combos(array, k - 1)
    for subcombo in subcombos {

        ret.append(sub)
    }
    array.removeAtIndex(0)
    ret += combos(array, k)

    return ret
}

","<p>If you have firstName and lastName be optional strings, you can compare them against nil and use them in a boolean expression. </p>

<p>Your second error is due to the extra paren after your closure. This code should work. </p>

<pre><code>var predicate: NSPredicate = NSPredicate { (AnyObject person, NSDictionary bindings) -&gt; Bool in
    var firstName: String? = ABRecordCopyValue(person as ABRecordRef, kABPersonFirstNameProperty).takeRetainedValue() as? String
    var lastName: String? = ABRecordCopyValue(person as ABRecordRef, kABPersonLastNameProperty).takeRetainedValue() as? String

<p><code>init</code> is just a keyword meaning ""the following is a constructor"". The constructor is called always via <code>MyClass()</code> during the creation of a new instance. It's never called separately as a method <code>myInstance.init()</code>. You can't get a reference to the underlying function because it would be impossible to call it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Modifying Value Types from Within Instance Methods</strong></p>
  
  <p>Structures and enumerations are value types. By default, the properties of a value type cannot be modified from within its instance methods.</p>
  
  <p>However, if you need to modify the properties of your structure or enumeration within a particular method, you can opt in to mutating behavior for that method. The method can then mutate (that is, change) its properties from within the method, and any changes that it makes are written back to the original structure when the method ends. The method can also assign a completely new instance to its implicit self property, and this new instance will replace the existing one when the method ends.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>So then, a <code>struct</code> cannot modify itself unless the function doing the modification is flagged as <code>mutating</code>. This means you need to define a proper <code>get</code> function for the property.</p>

<pre><code>var magnitude: Double {
mutating get {
    if magnitudeActual &lt; 0.0 {
        NSLog(""Recalc"") // just to make sure it's caching the result properly.
        magnitudeActual = sqrt(x * x + y * y)
    }
    return magnitudeActual
}
}

<p>Now we can do this</p>

<pre><code>var v = Vector(3, 4)
v.magnitude // Recalc 5
v.magnitude // 5

v.x = 5
v.y = 12
v.magnitude // Recalc 13

<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WorkingWithCocoaDataTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH6-XID_40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WorkingWithCocoaDataTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH6-XID_40</a></p>

<p>Specifically this statement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remapped Types</p>
  
  <p>When Swift imports Core Foundation types, the compiler remaps the
  names of these types. The compiler removes Ref from the end of each
  type name because all Swift classes are reference types, therefore the
  suffix is redundant.</p>
  
  <p>The Core Foundation CFTypeRef type completely remaps to the AnyObject
  type. Wherever you would use CFTypeRef, you should now use AnyObject
  in your code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing you would like to do, is to remove the ""ref"" from each type.
However it's not necessary, since the ""refs"" are typealiased to the ""non-ref"" types.</p>

<p>Then, this statement should work. It may need some tuning before I've never worked with <code>CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer</code>, and for this reason I'm not sure about the first line (initialize the buffer)</p>

<pre><code>    var buf : CMSampleBuffer = // initialize the buffer
    var anUnmanaged : Unmanaged&lt;CVImageBuffer&gt; = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(buf)
    var returnValue = anUnmanaged.takeUnretainedValue()
</code></pre>

<p>Or, shortly</p>

<pre><code>    var buf : CMSampleBuffer = // initialize the buffer
    var anUnmanaged : CVImageBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(buf).takeRetainedValue()
</code></pre>

<p>However, you asked for a CVPixelBuffer. 
If the two types are fully compatible (I don't know the underlying API so I assume that casting between CVPixelBuffer and CVImageBuffer in objc is always safe), there is no ""automatism"" to do it, you have to pass through an Unsafe Pointer.</p>

<p>The complete code is this:</p>

<pre><code>    var buf : CMSampleBuffer = // initialize the buffer
    var anUnmanaged : Unmanaged&lt;CVImageBuffer&gt; = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(buf)
    var returnValue = anUnmanaged.takeUnretainedValue()

    var anOpaque = anUnmanaged.toOpaque()
    var pixelBuffer : CVPixelBuffer = Unmanaged&lt;CVPixelBuffer&gt;.fromOpaque(anOpaque).takeUnretainedValue()
</code></pre>

<p>I used takeUnretainedValue() that doesn't consume a retain count, since CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer() returns an unretained object</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>The previous answer about objc_setAssociatedObject() is the right approach, but I think Apple's APIs for this have not yet been vetted, because I've had difficulty using them the way I think they ought to be used. (I shouldn't have to muck about with unsafe pointers and such.) Here's the solution I'm using now.</p>

<p>First, you need a bit of Objective-C glue (follow Apple's instructions for mixing Objective-C and Swift in the same project:</p>

<pre><code>// RuntimeGlue.h
// Should be included from your bridging header.

@import Foundation;

void setAssociatedObject_glue(NSObject *object, const NSString *key, NSObject *value);
NSObject *getAssociatedObject_glue(NSObject *object, const NSString* key);


// RuntimeGlue.m

#import ""RuntimeGlue.h""
#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

void setAssociatedObject_glue(NSObject *object, const NSString *key, NSObject *value) {
    objc_setAssociatedObject(object, (__bridge const void *)(key), value, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN_NONATOMIC);
}

NSObject *getAssociatedObject_glue(NSObject *object, const NSString* key) {
    return objc_getAssociatedObject(object, (__bridge const void *)(key));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, the Swift methods you'll call from the rest of your program:</p>

<pre><code>// Runtime.swift

import Foundation

public func setAssociatedObject(#object: NSObject, #key: NSString, #value: NSObject?) {
    setAssociatedObject_glue(object, key, value)
}

public func getAssociatedObject(#object: NSObject, #key: NSString) -&gt; NSObject? {
    return getAssociatedObject_glue(object, key)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, an example of use to tag a particular view controller's view as ""debugging"".</p>

<pre><code>// MyViewController.swift

import UIKit

let debugKey: NSString = ""DebugKey""

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        setAssociatedObject(object: self.view, key: debugKey, value: ""debugging"")
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool)  {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)

        let val = getAssociatedObject(object: self.view, key: debugKey)
        println(""val:\(val)"")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach lets you pass <code>nil</code> for <code>value</code> to the setter in order to clear the value for the key, and returns an optional from the getter. Note also that the <code>key</code> argument must be identical in both cases (k1 === k2) and not merely equivalent (k1 == k2).</p>

<p>Also note that this only lets you tag instances of NSObject or its subclasses-- it does not work for Swift native classes. The <code>value</code> must also be an NSObject subclass, but both strings and number literals automatically bridge to Objective-C, so you don't need to do any explicit casting.</p>
"
630,24831850,5,3,swift,How should I replace these screen size and device type macros in Swift?,"<p>Back in Objective-C, I defined the following macros in a <code>constants.h</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>#define IS_IPHONE5 (([[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.height-568)?NO:YES)
#define IS_IPAD    (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM()==UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad)
#define IS_IOS7 ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] &gt;= 7)
#define APP_DEFAULT_FONT_FACE @""HelveticaNeue-Light""
#define APP_DEFAULT_FONT_FACE_THIN @""HelveticaNeue-UltraLight""
#define APP_VERSION @""1.2""
</code></pre>

<p>I started playing with Swift and I noticed that these things just don't work anymore.  So now how should I define these macros, and detect which family the device belongs to?</p>

<p>And if Swift doesn't have macros, what is the syntax of doing it?</p>
","<p>In this case, the easiest way to define these constants seems to be to use the <code>let</code> keyword. Macros are not available in Swift, so you have to use constants in this case (which may be better in terms of performance anyhow, in this case):</p>

<pre><code>let IS_IPHONE5 = fabs(UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.size.height-568) &lt; 1;      
let IS_IPAD = (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM()==UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad);
let IS_IOS8 = (UIDevice.currentDevice().systemVersion.floatValue &gt;= 8)
let APP_DEFAULT_FONT_FACE_NAME = ""HelveticaNeue-Light"";
let APP_DEFAULT_FONT_FACE_THIN_NAME = ""HelveticaNeue-UltraLight"";
let APP_VERSION_STRING = ""1.2"";
</code></pre>

<p>for the <code>IS_IPHONE5</code> constant, I used <code>fabs</code> to avoid possible floating point rounding errors. I'm not sure if they would be an issue, but it's better to be safe...</p>

<p>The <code>IS_IOS7</code> macro is useless in Swift, because Swift <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001778/do-swift-based-applications-work-on-os-x-10-9-ios-7-and-lower"">only supports iOS 7 and later versions</a> (<code>IS_IOS7</code> would always be <code>YES</code> in a Swift program.) I added an <code>IS_IOS8</code> constant instead...</p>

","<p>Typhoon assemblies make good use of the ObjC runtime's dyanmic dispatch features. Assemblies are reflected, and each method intercepted (applying an AOP 'around' advice) so that Typhoon has a blueprint to build each of the components in the app's assembly. However, Swift will try to use static/vtable dispatch where possible (which prevents the required method interception). </p>

<p>To instruct Swift that dynamic dispatch is required, mark your assembly methods as 'dynamic'. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> (Requires Xcode6 beta 6)</p>

<pre><code>public class MYAssembly : TyphoonAssembly {

    public dynamic func serviceA() -&gt; AnyObject {
        var definitionBlock : TyphoonDefinitionBlock = {

827,25273260,-1,3,swift,Swift: Use wildcard as generic type parameter,"<p>I'd like to store instances of a class derived from a generic type in a Dictionary; that is, the Dictionary should store an instance of <em>any</em> class derived from this generic.</p>

","<p>You need to parameterize the type containing whatever reference is to be made generic, and use a type constraint there. Also, the typealias relates to the constraints on the parameterized type, so it goes inside that type.</p>

<p>The <code>motionMethod</code> gets called, though the text of my UILabel stays the same for several seconds before it finally updates.</p>

<p>So here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>let delegate = (UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate)

var player:Player!
var motionManager: CMMotionManager?

let accThreshold = 1.0

var referenceTime = NSDate()
let timeThreshold = 0.2

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    player = delegate.chancesPlayer
    let queue = NSOperationQueue()

    motionManager = delegate.motionManager
    motionManager?.startDeviceMotionUpdatesToQueue(queue, withHandler: {
        (motion: CMDeviceMotion!, error:NSError!) in
        self.motionMethod(motion)
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the <code>motionMethod</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func motionMethod(deviceMotion: CMDeviceMotion){
    var acceleration = deviceMotion.userAcceleration
    if fabs(acceleration.x) &gt; accThreshold || fabs(acceleration.y) &gt; accThreshold || fabs(acceleration.z) &gt; accThreshold{
        if -referenceTime.timeIntervalSinceNow &gt; timeThreshold{

            println(""Player ist now at size: \(player.growth)"")         //this gets called frequently...
            growthTF.text = ""Player ist now at size: \(player.growth)""  //...that doesn't
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So why is there a delay in the update of the text?</p>
","<p>You're updating the label on a thread other than the main (UI) thread, which is undefined behavior. You should either use GCD to dispatch back to the main thread for the UI updates inside the closure, like this:</p>

<pre><code>func motionMethod(deviceMotion: CMDeviceMotion){
    var acceleration = deviceMotion.userAcceleration
    if fabs(acceleration.x) &gt; accThreshold || fabs(acceleration.y) &gt; accThreshold || fabs(acceleration.z) &gt; accThreshold{
        if -referenceTime.timeIntervalSinceNow &gt; timeThreshold{

            referenceTime = NSDate()
            player.grow()

            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
                growthTF.text = ""Player ist now at size: \(player.growth)""  //...that doesn't
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you could specify that the updates should happen on the main queue.</p>

<pre><code>motionManager?.startDeviceMotionUpdatesToQueue(NSOperationQueue.mainQueue(), withHandler: {

837,25300130,8,3,swift,Implement enumerable/collection class in Swift,"<p>I am trying to implement class (implements SequenceType), and it seems to be a bit complicated than I was expecting. In C# I just need to implement <code>IEnumerable</code> and ""<code>yield return</code>"" makes it quite easy. The same in python with <code>__iter__()</code> and with <code>yield</code>. But in Swift I don't know why it happens to be overly complicated.
Here is the code </p>

<pre><code>class Nums : SequenceType{

    let list = [1,2,3,4,5]

    func generate() -&gt; GeneratorOf&lt;Int?&gt; {

        return GeneratorOf&lt;Int?&gt;{

                return i
            }

            return nil
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I am calling it in <code>for-in</code> it goes into infinite loop. </p>

<p>What is the proper way if implementing iterable classes in swift ?</p>
","<p><code>return</code> inside a generator does not work like <code>yield</code> in C#, Python, and other languages. It's just a plain <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>Instead, Swift generators use optional vaules â <code>Some(x)</code> indicates the next item in the sequence, and <code>None</code> (or <code>nil</code>) signals the end of the sequence.</p>

<p>The block you pass to the <code>GeneratorOf&lt;Int&gt;</code> constructor (by the way, there is no need to use <code>Int?</code>) will be called <em>at each step</em>, and should produce the next value each time it is called, or <code>nil</code> when it's done. So, you can use a mutable variable to keep track of state:</p>

<pre><code>func generate() -&gt; GeneratorOf&lt;Int&gt;
{
    var i = 0

    return GeneratorOf&lt;Int&gt; {
        if i &gt;= self.list.count { return nil }
        return self.list[i++]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can even use your <code>list</code>'s built-in generator:</p>

<pre><code>func generate() -&gt; GeneratorOf&lt;Int&gt;
{
    var g = self.list.generate()

    return GeneratorOf&lt;Int&gt; {
        return g.next() // not very exciting... we might as well have returned g itself
    }
}

I created new SpriteKit &amp; Swift game project in Xcode 6 and I edited file <code>GameScene.swift</code>. I didn't touch other files.

Everything works fine, except when doing a query and extracting the result. The issue is with the <code>UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;</code> that is returned from SQLite in Swift as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var querySQL = ""SELECT address, phone FROM CONTACTS WHERE NAME = 'myName'""
var cQuery = querySQL.cStringUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
var statement: COpaquePointer = nil
if sqlite3_prepare_v2(contactsDB, cQuery!, -1, &amp;statement, nil) == SQLITE_OK {
   if sqlite3_step(statement) == SQLITE_ROW {
   var address : UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt; = sqlite3_column_text(statement, 0)
   var data = NSData(bytes: address, length: 10)
   var string = NSString(data: data, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
   println(string)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we can convert the pointer to String if we know the length of the object (in this case 10)</p>

<p>To dig into this issue, I have the following example</p>

<pre><code>let pointerFromString: UnsafePointer&lt;Int8&gt; = ""xyz"".cStringUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
let stringFromPointer = String.fromCString(anotherPointerFromString_Int8)                    println(stringFromPointer!)

<p>Given that <code>CChar</code> is an alias of <code>Int8</code>, I can convert a <code>String</code> to <code>UnsafePointer&lt;Int8&gt;</code> using <code>.cStringUsingEncoding()</code>, and then back to <code>String</code> using <code>.fromCString(&lt;UnsafePointer_CChar&gt;)</code> </p>

<p>The problem is that my SQLite result is a <code>UnsafePointer_UInt8</code>, that canÂ´t be used with <code>.fromCString()</code></p>

<p>The bottom line question is: Is it possible to convert or cast a <code>UnsafePointer_UInt8</code> to <code>UnsafePointer_Int8</code></p>

","<p>The main issue is that your error message is reporting that ""... may only be called from the main thread"".

<p>Note, this code snippet makes a few minor, unrelated changes, namely:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It doesn't make sense to specify the destination view controller as its own sender. Usually you'd use the current view controller or some UIKit control as the <code>sender</code>.</p>

<p>I specified <code>self</code> as the <code>sender</code>, because I presume you did this in the source view controller. Or, if this was in an <code>IBAction</code> for a button, maybe you'd use the <code>sender</code> parameter of the <code>IBAction</code>, itself, instead of the source view controller.</p></li>
<li><p>I would lose the <code>AnyObject</code> cast. I know the compiler probably suggested it to you, but it doesn't help the legibility of the code. I'd suggest directly casting it to a <code>UIViewController</code>.</p></li>

<p>If we manipulate the codeunits and unicodeScales by removing some elements etc. is there a way to construct back the resulting string?</p>
","<p><strong>Update for Swift 2.1:</strong> </p>

<p>You can create a <code>String</code> from an array of UTF-16 characters
with the</p>

<pre><code>public init(utf16CodeUnits: UnsafePointer&lt;unichar&gt;, count: Int)
</code></pre>

<p>initializer. Example:</p>

<pre><code>let str = ""Hâ¬llo í ½í¸""

// String to UTF16 array:
let utf16array = Array(str.utf16)
print(utf16array)
// Output: [72, 8364, 108, 108, 111, 32, 55357, 56836]

// UTF16 array to string:
let str2 = String(utf16CodeUnits: utf16array, count: utf16array.count)
print(str2)
// Hâ¬llo í ½í¸
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><em>Previous answer:</em></p>

<p>There is nothing ""built-in"" (as far as I know), but you can use the <code>UTF16</code> struct
which provides a <code>decode()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>extension String {

    init?(utf16chars:[UInt16]) {
        var str = """"
        var generator = utf16chars.generate()
        var utf16 : UTF16 = UTF16()
        var done = false
        while !done {
            let r = utf16.decode(&amp;generator)
            switch (r) {
            case .EmptyInput:
                done = true
            case let .Result(val):
                str.append(Character(val))
            case .Error:
                return nil
            }
        }
        self = str
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>let str = ""Hâ¬llo í ½í¸""

// String to UTF16 array:
let utf16array = Array(str.utf16)
print(utf16array)
// Output: [72, 8364, 108, 108, 111, 32, 55357, 56836]

// UTF16 array to string:
if let str2 = String(utf16chars: utf16array) {
    print(str2)
    // Output: Hâ¬llo í ½í¸
}
</code></pre>

<p>Slightly more <em>generic</em>, you could define a method that creates a string
from an array (or any sequence) of code points, using a given codec:</p>

<pre><code>extension String {
    init?&lt;S : SequenceType, C : UnicodeCodecType where S.Generator.Element == C.CodeUnit&gt;
        (codeUnits : S, var codec : C) {
        var str = """"
        var generator = codeUnits.generate()
        var done = false
        while !done {
            let r = codec.decode(&amp;generator)
            switch (r) {
            case .EmptyInput:
                done = true
            case let .Result(val):
                str.append(Character(val))
            case .Error:
                return nil
            }
        }
        self = str
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the conversion from UTF16 is done as</p>

<pre><code>if let str2a = String(codeUnits: utf16array, codec: UTF16()) {
    print(str2a)
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Here is another possible solution. While the previous methods are ""pure Swift"", this one uses the Foundation framework and the automatic
bridging between <code>NSString</code> and Swift <code>String</code>:</p>

<pre><code>extension String {

    init?(utf16chars:[UInt16]) {
        let data = NSData(bytes: utf16chars, length: utf16chars.count * sizeof(UInt16))
        if let ns = NSString(data: data, encoding: NSUTF16LittleEndianStringEncoding) {
            self = ns as String
        } else {
            return nil
        }

<p><code>'NSNumber' is not a subtype of 'AEEventId'</code> for the <code>andEventID</code> argument</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong at this stage as both <code>kInternetEventClass</code> and <code>kAEGetURL</code> are constants defined by apple...  Surely I'm not required to convert their <code>NSNumber</code> type to their respective required types?  And if I am I can't work out how.</p>

","<p>You should never use <code>rand()</code>, use <code>arc4random</code> - it's a much better generator.  If you check its man-pages, you'll find that it has an integer range generator form called <code>arc4random_uniform()</code>, which you should use to avoid modulo bias when the modulus is not a power of 2.

391,24260900,0,3,swift,Equality of unwrapped optional arrays in Swift,"<p>I believe the following to be a bug, and have filed a Radar report on it
(#17340397). However, since Apple doesn't give much feedback on bug reports,
I'm here to ask smarter people than myself what they think.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

let b: Array&lt;Int&gt;? = [1,2,3]

a! == b!

explicitly unwrap these first, then it works:</p>

<pre><code>let a2 = a!
let b2 = b!

a2 == b2
</code></pre>

<p>That's true.</p>

<p>What am I missing?  It looks like there is some special magic happening when
the new assignment is made, but why?</p>

443,24331040,7,3,swift,UITraitCollection Clarification,"<p>I'm trying to figure out how to use <code>UITraitCollection</code> programatically, but I find it difficult to make sense of it. I'm developing for an iPad retina, in iOS 8.</p>

<p><code>println(self.traitCollection)</code> returns the following output:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;UITraitCollection: 0x10df4c7f0; _UITraitNameUserInterfaceIdiom = Pad,

 _UITraitNameInteractionModel = 1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is pretty straight forward.
But when I then rotate the screen, I get the exact same output. I.e., same vertical size class, and same horizontal size class.</p>

<p>So my question is, do I need to specify the size class I want for each device orientation (as far as I can see, the size classes are read-only properties!) or am I missing something obvious?
In the example given in the 'What's new in Cocoa-Touch' talk on the WWDC 2014 video site, he uses the iPhone as an example, which has different vertical / horizontal size classes for each device orientation.</p>

<p>How would you go about this?</p>
","<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This document</a> (scroll to <em>Unified Storyboards for Universal Apps</em>) explains the size classes for both iPads and iPhones. </p>

<p>Note that the iPhone is a bit tricky. All iPads are Regular-x-Regular in any orientation, but an iPhone's size classes change on orientation, from Regular(h)-x-Compact(w) in Portrait, to Compact-x-Compact in Landscape.</p>

<p>The rumored explanation for all these changes is that Apple might be introducing more screen resolutions soon, and the current number already requires a bunch of if-then's without these size classes. To ease this transition, I'd recommend thinking about things more like responsive web design, where you define a few general layouts, then stretch things to fit nicely at any exact size within one of those layouts.</p>

<p>EDIT:    </p>

<p>1) In case the link breaks, find the ""Whats New in iOS"" Apple Doc, go to the iOS8 section, and look for ""Supporting New Screen Sizes and Scales""</p>

<p>2) The iPhone 6+ has a regular width in landscape mode.</p>

","<p>In the SKNode class, the block argument to this message is of the type <code>(void (^)(SKNode *node, BOOL *stop))</code></p>

<p>When Swift imports an Objective-C class, all of its message arguments and return values are imported as optionals -- arguments you pass to functions are always <code>NSString?</code> or <code>NDSData?</code>, not just <code>NSString</code> or <code>NSData</code>.  They do this because all pointers in Obj-C can be nil, but a <code>var</code> in Swift <em>can't</em> be nil unless it has a question mark at the end, thus making it an ""optional"" type.</p>

","<p>Remove everything except the Application scene from the Main.storyboard file, and instead, create a new Application.storyboard for the application window. Implement an application delegate class and connect it to the Application object in Main.storyboard. Use this class to instantiate the window controller and set up custom options for the application window.</p>

<pre><code>class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {

","<p>In Yosemite, NSViewController has been promoted with powerful new features to make it work with Storyboards. Meanwhile, NSWindowController got demoted. With Storyboards, windows are no longer loaded from a nib, so windowDidLoad() doesn't get called anymore.</p>

<p>It makes sense for the window itself to become less important, in favor of a more powerful view it actually contains. My other answer on this page shows how to set up an AppDelegate to customize the window appearance. There's more detail <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24543911/3799712"">on another page here</a>, about using an AppDelegate to implement some of the things you might previously have done in an NSWindowController.</p>

<p>However, if you only wanted to catch windowDidLoad() as a way to customize the appearance options of the window, it is <strong><em>very easy</em></strong> to do that in Interface Builder, by simply adding them as User Defined Runtime Attributes to the NSWindow object. You don't need to subclass NSWindowController or write any code at all. Just plug in these values to the NSWindow object via the Identity Inspector pane to achieve the same effect shown in the AppDelegate example code:</p>

<pre><code>Keypath: titlebarAppearsTransparent, Type: Boolean, Value: Checked
Keypath: titleVisibility, Type: Number, Value: 1
Keypath: styleMask, Type: Number, Value: 32783
</code></pre>

<p>Look in the headers to determine the actual numeric values of the constants.</p>

<p>( for example: NSWindowTitleVisibility.Hidden = 1 )</p>

<p>Of course, you can't specify individual bits of the styleMask, but it's easy enough to add them all together and get a single number to specify the style. </p>

[M_PI, M_PI_2] % ""%.3f %.3f""
==&gt; ""3.142 1.571""
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this is highly type-unsafe because it's an unchecked printf as you say.</p>

<p>BTW, this even works with mixed-type stuff, and with non-literals:</p>

<pre><code>let x = 1
let y = 1.5
let z = ""yes""

[x, y, z] % ""%d, %.2f, %@""
==&gt; ""1, 1.50, yes""
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if that part is going to be fragile, however. Mixed-type literals are promoted to <code>NSArray</code>, which seems a dangerous thing to do automatically, so they may change it. But <code>NSArray</code> is acceptable as a <code>CVarArg[]</code>.</p>

<p>Note that not all types can be converted this way. Characters currently cannot for instance. You can overcome this by extending them to do so:</p>

<pre><code>extension Character : CVarArg {
  func encode() -&gt; Word[] {
    var result = Word[]()
    let s = String(self)
    for c in s.unicodeScalars {
      result.append(Word(c.value))
    }
    return result
  }
}

let c:Character = ""c""

[""I"", c, 2*3] % ""%@, %lc, %d""
==&gt; ""I, c, 6""
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering if there's an easier way to write <code>encode()</code>, but I'm not sure yet. Hopefully a Character encoding will be provided by Swift in the future. But the lesson here is that arbitrary types could be given an <code>encode</code> and be formatted.</p>

<pre><code>class Car {
  let make = ""Ford""
}

extension Car : CVarArg {
  func encode() -&gt; Word[] {
    return NSString(string:self.make).encode()
  }
}

let car = Car()

[car] % ""%@""
</code></pre>

<p>The lesson here is that you can turn arbitrary things into a <code>CVarArg</code> or into any protocol, via extensions.</p>

185,24063650,1,3,swift,Can't downcast Swift objects to protocols -- what to do?,"<p>I'm trying to write an extension method to Array similar to NSArray's <code>containsObject</code> method. Here's what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
    func contains(item: T) -&gt; Bool {
        for value in self {
            if item == value {
                return true
            }
        }
        return false
    }
}

<p>I get an error on the line <code>if item == value {</code> that says:</p>

<pre><code>""Could not find an overload for ""=="" that accepts the supplied arguments.""
</code></pre>

<p>I tried casting item and value to Equatable before the comparison, but it's not possible to downcast a non-objc object to a protocol</p>

<pre><code>var equatableItem = item as Equatable
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is:</p>

<pre><code>""Cannot downcast from 'T' to non-@objc protocol type 'Equatable'""
</code></pre>

<p>How would one implement this method in Swift? I'm not interested in using <code>bridgeToObjectiveC</code> and calling containsObject; this is more of an academic question if writing a method such as this is possible in pure Swift.</p>
","<p>The problem is that T is already defined and the Array's definition of T does not conform to Equatable. You can either accomplish what you want by casting, and risking an invalid cast, or you could pass in a delegate where no casting would be required.</p>

<p>Consider modifying like so:</p>

<pre><code>extension Array {
   func contains(comparator: (T)-&gt;Bool) -&gt; Bool {
    for item in self {
        if comparator(item) {
           return true
        }
    }
    return false
  }
}

        var exists = test.contains({(item)-&gt;Bool in item == 0});

<p>In the code above the first func declares the tableView as ! and in the second function tableView is declared as ?. </p>
","<p>As per the official Apple docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When working with optional values, you can write ? before operations
  like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the ?
  is nil, everything after the ? is ignored and the value of the whole
  expression is nil. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and
  everything after the ? acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the
  value of the whole expression is an optional value.</p>
  
  <p>Once youâre sure that the optional does contain a value, you can
  access its underlying value by adding an exclamation mark (!) to the
  end of the optionalâs name. The exclamation mark effectively says, âI
  know that this optional definitely has a value; please use it.â This
  is known as forced unwrapping of the optionalâs value (...)</p>

","<p>the problem was i didn't set the 'self.scrollView.pagingEnabled' to true. still i am now to UIKit.
any way i made some performance improvement, and the layout is call only when needed now,
hope someone will find this usfull :)

<p>You're treating the transform as the actual value. Instead, your dialer should maintain an angle property based on the gesture recognizer. The transform and the dial's value should both be based on that property.</p>

758,25133240,1,2,swift,timer.invalidate() not working on same view in Swift,"<p>I am using Swift to develop an app that uses timer so i am using this code for timer</p>

<pre><code>var timer = NSTimer()
timer=NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(1.0,target:self,selector:Selector(""updateTimeLabel""), userInfo:nil , repeats: true)
</code></pre>

<p>my problem is this when this game complete a view appears as subview of current view and the timer invalidates using </p>

<pre><code>timer.invalidate()
</code></pre>

<p>and on this subview there is a button to start a new game when this button is pressed a new game is started but the timer starts from the time it stopped.</p>

<p>suppose the game finished in 00:10 time so the subview appears and if we start new game then the time will start from 00:11. This works fine when user moves to another view and then comes back to the same view for game play, in this case the timer starts from 00:00
pls tell where i am wrong </p>

870,25395000,5,2,swift,"Sharing data between classes via delegates in Swift, iOS","<p>I am trying to get to know how delegates work a bit better in Swift, and in general. In the example I have created I have a <code>Sender</code> class and a <code>Receiver</code> class. I want to send a message from <code>Sender</code> to <code>Receiver</code></p>

<p>I then want to create a variable instance of the <code>Receiver</code> class and print the message that the <code>Sender</code> sent to it. However I am having difficulty as when I call the function <code>ShareMessage(message: NSString)</code> from the variable instance I have created <code>var recieveMessage</code> I have to type in another message or  string and I cannot retrieve the message that the <code>Sender</code> class sent to it.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am working with. I am not sure if what I am asking is correct, however I am just curious as how I go about retrieving the data in the variable instance.</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

// Protocol to send message between classes.
protocol SendersMessageDelegate{

    func shareMessage(message: NSString)
}

// Class that sends the message
class Sender{

    // Create variable to hold message
    var sendersMessage: NSString = NSString()

    var delegate: SendersMessageDelegate? = Receiver()

    // Grab the message when initialized and send to delegate
    init(sendersMessage: NSString){

        self.sendersMessage = sendersMessage
        delegate?.shareMessage(sendersMessage)
    }          

}

//Class receiving the message
class Receiver: SendersMessageDelegate{

    func shareMessage(message: NSString) {

        println(message)

    }
}

//Create variable instance of sender and send message in initializer.
var sendMessage: Sender = Sender(sendersMessage: ""Hello Receiver."")

var receiveMessage: Receiver = Receiver()
receiveMessage.shareMessage(message: NSString) &lt;---- //Can't retrieve message as need new argument for function call.
</code></pre>

<p>This is the bit I have trouble retrieving the <code>message</code> or data as I have to pass a new argument.</p>

<pre><code>receiveMessage.shareMessage(message: NSString)
</code></pre>
","<p>I think you have your logic mixed up a bit.</p>

<p>Your Sender is set up to create a Receiver by itself and then instantly send out a message to it on creation.</p>

<p>So when in this line:</p>

<pre><code>var sendMessage: Sender = Sender(sendersMessage: ""Hello Receiver."")
</code></pre>

<p>You've already done what you're trying to do in the next two lines. If you want to then have this receiver STORE the message and for you to retrieve later on, then you need your Receiver class to save this as a variable as well as print it out.</p>

<pre><code>class Receiver: SendersMessageDelegate{

    var savedMessage:NSString?

    func shareMessage(message: NSString) {
        savedMessage = message
        println(message)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which you can then access by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>var sharedMessage = receiver.savedMessage
</code></pre>

<p>The second issue that you have however is that because you've created the Receiver INSIDE your Sender you'll need to pull the receiver from it. </p>

<pre><code>var sender: Sender = Sender(sendersMessage: ""Hello Receiver."")
var receiver:Receiver = sender.delegate
var sharedMessage = receiver.savedMessage
</code></pre>

<p>Which is quite a strange thing to do. The usual pattern would be to create a Receiver and give it to the Sender. Then call a function in the Sender that would trigger a message being sent to the Receiver. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit

// Protocol to send message between classes.
protocol SendersMessageDelegate{
    func shareMessage(message: NSString)
}

// Class that sends the message
class Sender{

    // Create variable to hold message
    var sendersMessage: NSString = NSString()

    var delegate: SendersMessageDelegate?

    // Save the message that it needs to send
    init(sendersMessage: NSString){
        self.sendersMessage = sendersMessage
    }

    // If it has as a delegate, then share the message with it.
    func sendMessage() {
        delegate?.shareMessage(sendersMessage)
    }
}

//Class receiving the message
class Receiver: SendersMessageDelegate{

    var savedMessage:NSString?

    func shareMessage(message: NSString) {
        savedMessage = message
        println(message)
    }
}

//Create Sender and Receiver
var sender: Sender = Sender(sendersMessage: ""Hello Receiver."")
var receiver: Receiver = Receiver()

//give Sender it's Receiver
sender.delegate = receiver

//Trigger the sender to send message to it's Receiver
sender.sendMessage()

","<p>First of all I want to say that I am not really well-read in Swift, but this holds for any function returning functions:</p>

<p>Also I have to note that this is much easier to understand if you understand <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying"" rel=""nofollow"">currying</a>.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application"" rel=""nofollow"">partial function application</a>. In partial application, you take a function (lets take a simple <code>add</code> function as an example) and supply it with fewer parameters than it actually needs to yield it's supposed result. The result if this is a function which takes the rest of the parameters. A curried <code>add</code> would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>func add(a: Int)(b: Int) -&gt; Int {
    return a + b
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can now do this:</p>

<p>Can someone point me to a good example for when you wanna return a function from another function ? </p>
","<p>Here is an actual example, a utility function I've been using in my own apps.</p>

<h3>The problem:</h3>

<p>As you probably know, drawing an image in code is accomplished by a patterned dance with this form:</p>

<pre><code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(CGSizeMake(100,100), false, 0)
// do stuff
let im = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
// use im here...
</code></pre>

<p>There are several drawbacks to this structure: It's boring boilerplate, sure, but even worse, its key purpose is to generate the image, which happens on the next-to-last line â but then the image can't be used until <em>after the last line</em> (in other words, the structure ""buries the lede"", concealing its own purpose). </p>

<p>Also, it's error-prone (ever omit the <code>UIGraphicsEndImageContext</code> by mistake?). Plus any local variables interfere with local variables in the surrounding scope.</p>

<h3>First solution:</h3>

<p>All of these problems can be solved easily in Swift with a utility function that takes a closure:</p>

<pre><code>func imageOfSize(size:CGSize, closure:() -&gt; ()) -&gt; UIImage {
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(size, false, 0)
    closure()
    let result = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
    return result
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.image = imageOfSize(CGSizeMake(100,100)) {
    let con = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextAddEllipseInRect(con, CGRectMake(0,0,100,100))
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(con, UIColor.blueColor().CGColor)
    CGContextFillPath(con)
}
</code></pre>

<p>That calling syntax is far more expressive of what we're really doing (we're making an image and using it!), and it omits the boilerplate and provides a contained scope for any local variable (though there were none in this example).</p>

<h3>Good, but...</h3>

<p>This is very good, but observe that I've had to supply two default values in the call to <code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions</code>, namely <code>false</code> and <code>0</code>. Granted, these are the most common defaults. But it would be nice to write a version that lets us specify them, or at least the second parameter (opaque or not).</p>

<p>At the same time, it would be nice <em>not to have to specify this all the time</em>, since <code>false</code> is in fact the most common value. Thus what we want is an <em>optional</em> second parameter, <code>opaque:Bool = false</code>.</p>

<p>The trouble is that you <em>can't have an optional second parameter when the third parameter is a closure</em>; the compiler complains when you try to make the call while omitting the second parameter.</p>

<h3>Second solution: a function that makes a function!</h3>

<p>The solution is to ""curry"" the function into two functions, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One function takes a single optional <code>opaque</code> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>The other function takes a closure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>func drawnImage (opaque:Bool = false) -&gt; (CGSize, () -&gt; ()) -&gt; UIImage {
    func imageOfSize(size:CGSize, closure:() -&gt; ()) -&gt; UIImage {
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(size, opaque, 0)
        closure()
        let result = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
        return result
    }
    return imageOfSize
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.image = drawnImage()(CGSizeMake(100,100)) {
    let con = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextAddEllipseInRect(con, CGRectMake(0,0,100,100))
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(con, UIColor.blueColor().CGColor)
    CGContextFillPath(con)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if opaque, like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.image = drawnImage(opaque:true)(CGSizeMake(100,100)) {
    let con = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextAddEllipseInRect(con, CGRectMake(0,0,100,100))
    CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(con, UIColor.blueColor().CGColor)
    CGContextFillPath(con)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thus the ability of a function to generate a function in Swift lets us bend the language to our will, giving us a convenient calling syntax in both cases.</p>

<p>I just encountered something similar, also with a dictionary. The problem seems to be what I would call a double-cast. <code>dict[""title""]</code> is an <code>AnyObject!</code> â that is to say, it's an Optional. The fact that it's implicitly unwrapped is irrelevant for the moment. Now you are asking to cast that to a String. So you are taking two casting steps at once:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to unwrap the Optional</li>
<li>You want what's inside the Optional, which is typed as an AnyObject, to be castable to a String</li>
</ul>

<p>It is this double-cast that gives the compiler trouble. It should provide a better error message, and since this issue is readily reproducible, you should file a bug. Nonetheless, I think this kind of double-casting is wrong. You have to do it in two steps (as bulleted above): first find out whether <code>dict[""title""]</code> is nil, and then and only then, if it is not, unwrap it and see if you can cast to a String.</p>

<p>(The situation is not helped by the fact that the interplay between NSDictionary and Dictionary is not as clean as it might be. In my case things were even more complicated, because the dictionary was coming out of user defaults, so it <em>itself</em> was an Optional.)</p>

","<p>""unable to boot ios simulator"" is a generic error for when the simulated runtime's bootstrap server (launchd_sim) does not respond within a certain time period.  It usually responds in less than 1/100th of this time.  This can occur if something is preventing launchd_sim from running.  Check for crash logs in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports or /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</p>

<p>This is most often caused by the setting of DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.  Do you have DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES set?  To find out, open Terminal.app and run 'echo $DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES'</p>

<p>dyld_sim will attempt to log that it is ignoring the library because it is a host dylib and not a simulator dylib.  It uses logging routines provided by the host's dyld to do this, but on Mavericks, dyld has a bug and will crash.  This is fixed in Yosemite's dyld.</p>

<p>Try unsetting DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES or upgrading to Yosemite if that is the case.  If that is not the case, I'm curious what your crash logs reveal.</p>

Like in minecraft pocket edition or terraria. When you create a server the other person needs to be on the same Wi-Fi. Does someone know how to do that? Is it even called socket? If someone have a Swift source code that let's multiple iPhone's send a string to one iPhone. If the one phone can send back a string or some thing that would be great!</p>

","<p>Tuples are heavily used in Python and it seems to me they have mostly the same purpose in Swift. Think of it as a <strong>quick way to deliver multiple values</strong> from one point to another. An example that shows up in the Swift book and a pattern that is used in Python very often is returning an HTTP status code and a text body from a method:</p>

<pre><code>func greeting() {
    return (200, ""Hello World"")
}

let (status, body) = greeting()

<blockquote>
  <p>Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values. They are not suited to the creation of complex data structures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They define ""temporary"" through the scope of the data: if a piece of data never leaves the scope of a single method, or a group of methods of the same object, it can be considered temporary, even though it might very well persist through the lifetime of an application.</p>

<p>If your data structure is useful outside a temporary scope - for example, because it needs to be returned from a public method of your class, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple.</p>

<p>Another important consideration is associating behavior with your data: if your object needs to have methods, use classes for them. Use tuples only for data devoid of behavior.</p>

<p>I want to use UIView as a ""container"" for a CALayer so that its width and height are always the same as the UIView (for flexibility purposes). </p>

    let frameWidth:CGFloat = superlayer.frame.width
    let frameHeight:CGFloat = superlayer.frame.height

    let frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, frameWidth, frameHeight)

    println(""\(superlayer.frame.width) // \(superlayer.frame.height)"")

    return frame

}

}

    leftSegmentUIView.layer.addSublayer(activeSegment)

","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You have to set <code>contentsScale</code> of the layer to something larger than the default 1.0.</p>

<p>Since you are doing custom drawing into context that has fewer pixels than the devices screen, the drawing looks pixelated. For traditional ""retina"" screens, the scale factor you are expecting is <code>2.0</code> but with the recent introduction of the iPhone 6+ there is also the scale factor of <code>3.0</code>.

The last exercise gives me a lot of headaches, I am trying to construct a function that returns the common elements of two sequences passed as parameters. Here is the code I tried:</p>

<pre><code>func anyCommonElements &lt;T, U where T: SequenceType, U: SequenceType, T.Generator.Element:

1040,25874300,1,2,swift,Swift: protocols: Capturing compatibility between types,"<p>I am hoping to write code that allows me to build bindings between different types like this:</p>

<pre><code>Map.add(1.0).to(CGPointZero) // (x:1.0, y:1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a contrived example, but if it can work, can be a nice way of capturing relations.  In C++, this would be straight forward, you would create something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Binding&lt;typename FromType&gt; {

    FromType from;

    to&lt;typename ToType&gt;(ToType toType) {
        return from + toType
    }
}

class Map {

     Binding&lt;T&gt; add&lt;T&gt;(t:T) {
        return Binding&lt;T&gt;(t:t)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the compiler would figure out whether or not these types could be added.</p>

<p>Swift is another animal though, and you need to capture this relationship ahead of type with a protocol.  It might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public protocol ScalarArithmetic {
    typealias SomeScalarType

     func +(lhs: SomeScalarType, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
}

//  Double + CGPoint
public func + (lhs:Double, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}

//  Float + CGPoint
public func + (lhs:Float, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}


class Binding&lt;T&gt; {
    var from: T

    init(t:T) { self.from = t }

    func to&lt;S:ScalarArithmetic where S.SomeScalarType == T&gt;(s:S) -&gt; S {
        return self.from + s
    }
}

class Map {

    class func add&lt;T&gt;(t:T) -&gt; Binding&lt;T&gt; {
        return Binding&lt;T&gt;(t:t)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The question though, is how do you bind a type - let's use CGPoint for an example, with multiple scalar types, so the above machinery could be used for a range of bindings (like the C++ sample above).</p>

<p>This doesn't work, as the compiler doesn't like duplicate statements:</p>

<pre><code>extension CGPoint : ScalarArithmetic {
    typealias SomeScalarType = Double

}

extension CGPoint : ScalarArithmetic {
    typealias SomeScalarType = Float
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried capturing the scalar type as in it's own protocol - and maybe that's the way to do it, but it pushes the problem down the road a bit:</p>

<pre><code>public protocol SomeScalarType {}
extension Double: SomeScalarType {}
extension Float: SomeScalarType {}

public protocol ScalarArithmetic {
    func +(lhs: SomeScalarType, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self
}

//  Double + CGPoint
public func + (lhs:Double, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}

//  Float + CGPoint
public func + (lhs:Float, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}

extension CGPoint: ScalarArithmetic {} // does not conform to ScalarArithmetic
// since it is not implemented in terms of the ScalarArithmetic protocol,
// despite having the necessary operators.
</code></pre>

<p>So to talk myself into my own answer, does that leave as the only option, making ScalarType ""convertable-enough"", that it can be cast to the desired primitive type:</p>

<pre><code>public func + (lhs:SomeScalarType, rhs:SomeScalarType) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}
</code></pre>

<p>How would I do this, and/or are there better solutions?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>Swift intentionally does not coerce types for you very much. That's a language choice, and circumventing it is going to be hard. You cannot <code>+</code> arbitrary numeric types. Your C++ example works because arbitrary number things can add, whereas they can't in Swift.</p>

<p>IMO, the correct answer for what you're trying to do is exactly:</p>

<pre><code>public func + (lhs:Double, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + CGFloat(lhs), y:rhs.y + CGFloat(lhs))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Full stop. But this is a terrible thing to attach to <code>+</code>. You cannot <code>+</code> a scalar and a vector meaningfully. This kind of thing is better defined as:</p>

<pre><code>public func + (lhs:CGPoint, rhs:CGPoint) -&gt; CGPoint {
    return CGPoint(x: rhs.x + lhs.x, y:rhs.y + lhs.y)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then craft the <code>CGPoint</code> you want to add (even if you have to create a <code>Diagonal(1)</code> function to help. I know this is a contrived example, but I expect the same is true for the full problem. Making types automatically coerce should be done with extreme care. It is almost always better to create an <code>init</code> that lets you explicitly convert one to the other. Then operators makes sense.</p>

<p>This is all a strength in Swift in allowing much stronger type safety. For instance, I have some code like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Frequency and Time are reciprocols
public func *(lhs: SignalTime,      rhs: SignalFrequency) -&gt; Double { return lhs.seconds * rhs.hertz }
public func *(lhs: SignalFrequency, rhs: SignalTime)      -&gt; Double { return rhs * lhs }

public func /(lhs: Double, rhs: SignalFrequency) -&gt; SignalTime { return SignalTime(seconds: lhs / rhs.hertz) }
public func /(lhs: Double, rhs: SignalTime)      -&gt; SignalFrequency { return SignalFrequency(hertz: lhs / rhs.seconds) }

// Frequency can be scaled by a constant
public func *(lhs: SignalFrequency, rhs: Double)          -&gt; SignalFrequency { return SignalFrequency(hertz: lhs.hertz * rhs) }
public func *(lhs: Double,          rhs: SignalFrequency) -&gt; SignalFrequency { return rhs * lhs }
</code></pre>

<p>It's all very explicit and even tedious, but it should be. There are useful ways to combine these types and there are illegal ways to combine these types. <code>x/y</code> returns a completely different type than <code>y/x</code>. Doing it this way has caught several ""oh, I was accidentally multiplying a frequency by a frequency"" bugs at the compile stage. Trying to make all of this ""magically work"" with minimal code tends to over-extend the types in ways that permit illegal operations.</p>

<p>I'd avoid <code>ScalarArithmetic</code> until you had a really good and unambiguous use case. If you have a different example, it'd be interesting to look at, but I expect the answer is similar. Be careful of over-extending coercion.</p>

<li>Sometimes you want your UIAlertView to work different in different contexts. If you set your custom UIAlertView to be delegate of itself it has to provide all those contexts (a lot of if/else statements). You can also set seperate delegate for each context.</li>
<li>This way you say to your compiler that every class (id) which implements protocol ClassesDelegate can be set to this property. As a side note it should usually be <code>weak</code> instead of <code>strong</code> to not introduce reference cycle (class A holds B, and B holds A)</li>
<li>Protocol (interface in other languages) is used to define set of methods which should be implemented by class. If class conforms to the protocol you can call this methods without knowledge of the specific class. Delegate is pattern in which class A delegates some work to class B (e.g. abstract printer delegates his work real printer)</li>
<li>When you need few different behaviours which depends on context (e.g. <code>ContactsViewController</code> needs to refresh his list when download is finished, but <code>SingleContactViewController</code> needs to reload image, labels etc.)</li>
<li>It is one of the most fundamental patterns in programming, so yes.</li>
<li>It's the same method</li>

","<p>The advantage of delegation is Dependency Inversion.</p>

<p>Usually code has a compile-time dependency in the same direction of the run-time calling dependency. If this was the case the <code>UITableview</code> class would have a compile-time dependence on our code since it calls our code. By using delegation this is inverted, our code has a compile-time dependency on the <code>UITableview</code> class but the <code>UITableview</code> class calls our code at run-time.</p>

<p>There is a cost involved: we need to set the delegate and UITableview has to check at run-time that the delegate method is implemented.</p>

<p>Note: When I say <code>UITableview</code> I am including <code>UITableviewDelegate</code> and <code>UITableviewDatasource</code>.</p>

769,25155080,4,2,swift,How to compare Swift String.Index?,"<p>So I have an instance of <code>Range&lt;String.Index&gt;</code> obtained from a search method.

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>let str = ""Hello!""

let range = Range(start: str.startIndex, end: str.endIndex)
let anIndex = advance(str.startIndex, 3)

// How to tell if `anIndex` is within `range` ?
</code></pre>

<p>Since comparison operators do not work on <code>String.Index</code> instances, the only way seems to be to perform a loop through the string using <code>advance</code> but this seems overkill for such a simple operation.</p>
","<p>The beta 5 release notes mention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea of a Range has been split into three separate concepts:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Ranges, which are Collections of consecutive discrete <code>ForwardIndexType</code> values. Ranges  are used for slicing and iteration.</li>
  <li>Intervals over <code>Comparable</code> values, which can efficiently check for containment. Intervals are  used for pattern matching in switch
  statements and by the <code>~=</code> operator.</li>
  <li>Striding over <code>Strideable</code> values, which are Comparable and can be advanced an arbitrary  distance in O(1).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Efficient containment checking is what you want, and this is possible since <code>String.Index</code> is <code>Comparable</code>:</p>

<pre><code>let range = str.startIndex..&lt;str.endIndex as HalfOpenInterval
// or this:
let range = HalfOpenInterval(str.startIndex, str.endIndex)

let anIndex = advance(str.startIndex, 3)

range.contains(anIndex) // true
// or this:
range ~= anIndex // true
</code></pre>

<p>(For now, it seems that explicitly naming <code>HalfOpenInterval</code> is necessary, otherwise the <code>..&lt;</code> operator creates a <code>Range</code> by default, and <code>Range</code> doesn't support <code>contains</code> and <code>~=</code> because it uses only <code>ForwardIndexType</code>.)</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to go through this, I am desperately looking for a clear and helpful answers to my questions, feel free to give example or cover some related topic!</p>
","<p>Firstly, don't feel bad that all if stuff isn't clear yet. This is a good example of something that seems tricky at first, but just takes time really click. That will happen before you know it :-). I'll try and answer each of your points above:</p>

<p>1) Think of it this way - the way UIAlertView works now, it allows Apple to âdelegateâ the implementation of the alertView:clickedButtonAtIndex: to you. If this was an instance method of UIAlertView, it would be the same implementation for everyone. To customize the implementation would then require subclassing - an often over relied upon design pattern. Apple tends to go with composition over inheritance in their frameworks and this is an example of that. You can read more on that concept here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance</a></p>

<p>2) The delegate property is a reference to the object which implements the delegation methods and whichs should be used to âdelegateâ those tasks to. The weird syntax just means this - a property that holds a reference to an object that adheres to the  protocol. </p>

<p>3) Not quite - delegation leverages protocols as a means for itâs implementation. In the example above, the  is this the name of a protocol that an object which can be considered a delegate for that class must adhere to. It is inside that protocol that the methods for which a delegate of that class must implement are defined. You can also have optional protocol methods but thatâs a different topic.</p>

<p>4) If I understand the question correctly, I think a good sign that you may want a delegate to be implemented instead of simply adding instance methods to your object is when you think that you may want the implementation of those methods to be easily swapped out or changed. When the implementation of those methods changes considerably based on where/how the functionality your building is being used</p>

<p>5) Absolutely! Objective-C and Swift are programming languages and the delegation pattern is an example of a design pattern. In general design patterns are hoziontal concepts that transcend across the verticals of programming languages.</p>

<p>6) Iâm not sure I understand you exactly but I think thereâs a bit of misunderstanding in the question - the method does not get called twice. The method declared in the delegate protocol is called once - typically from the class that contains the delegate property. The class calls the delegates implementation of that property via something like:</p>

<p>[self.delegate someMethodThatMyDelegateImplemented]; </p>

<p>I hope some of this helped!</p>

","<p>You can't just add a method to UIAlertView, because you don't have the source code. You'd have to subclass UIAlertView. But since you have more than one use of UIAlertView, You'd need several subclasses. That's very inconvenient. </p>

<p>Now let's say you use a library that subclasses UIAlertView, giving more functionality. That's trouble, because now you need to subclass this subclass instead of UIAlertView. </p>

<p>Now let's say that library uses different subclasses of UIAlertview, depending on whether you run on iOS 7 or 8, and UIAlertview unchanged on iOS 6. You're in trouble. Your subclassing pattern breaks down. </p>

<p>Instead, you create a delegate doing all the things specific to one UIAlertview. That delegate will work with the library just fine. Instead of subclassing a huge and complicated class, you write a very simple class. Most likely the code using the UIAlertview knows exactly what the delegate should be doing, so you can keep that code together. </p>

","<p>Maybe a real life example can better describe what's different in the delegation design pattern.</p>

<p>Suppose you open a new business, and you have an accountant to take care of the bureaucratic stuffs. </p>

<p><strong>Scenario #1</strong></p>

<p>You go to his office, and give him the information he needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>the company name</li>
<li>the company # number/id</li>
<li>the number of employees</li>
<li>the email address</li>
<li>the street address</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the accountant will store the data somewhere, and will probably tell you <strong>""don't forget to call me if there's any change""</strong>. </p>

<p>Tomorrow you hire a new employee, but forget to notify your accountant. He will still use the original outdated data you provided him.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario #2</strong></p>

<p>Using the delegation pattern, you go to your accountant, and you provide him your phone number (the delegate), and nothing else. </p>

<p>Later, he'll call you, asking: what's the business name?</p>

<p>Later, he'll call you, asking: how many employees do you have?</p>

<p>Later, he'll call you, asking: what's your company address?</p>

<p>The day after you hire a new employee.</p>

<p>2 days later, he'll call you asking: how many employee do you have?</p>

<p>In the delegation model (scenario #2), you see that your accountant will always have on demand up-to-date data, because he will call you every time he needs data. That's what ""don't call me, I'll call you"" means when talking of inversion of control (from the accountant perspective).</p>

<p>Transposing that in development, for example to populate a table you have 2 options:</p>

<ul>
<li>instantiate a table control, pass all the data (list of items to display), then ask the table to render itself</li>
<li>instantiate a table control, give it a pointer to a delegate, and let it call the delegate when it needs to know:
<ul>
<li>the number of rows in the table</li>
<li>the data to display on row no. n</li>
<li>the height the row no. n should have</li>
<li>etc.
but also when:</li>
<li>the row no. n has been tapped</li>
<li>the header has been tapped</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>How can I fix that?</p>
","<p>I think this actually depends on what you're using as your SKShapeNode. If you're using a rectangle, then the point you give it will be the lower left corner of the rectangle. But if you use a SKShapeNode circle, it'll drop the circle centered on that point you give it, and you'll see very similar behavior to the SKSpriteNode.</p>

<p>The SKSpriteNode is using the center of the image as the point it places your sprite at, and so when you're placing your node at (0, 100), exactly half of it is being draw to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>If you want your sprite to be drawn as far left as possible, but completely on the screen, you should be able to accomplish this by offsetting for one half of the sprite's width.</p>

557,24654560,2,2,swift,swift global constants: cannot use another constant for initialization,"<p>Here is what I am trying to do:</p>

<p>Swift allows me to declare <code>screenRect</code>.</p>

<p>However, it does not allow me to declare any other constants using this. It shows me the error: <code>'ViewController.Type' does not have a member named 'screenRect'</code></p>

<p>How do I define these constants and why does not swift allow me to use another constnt to define them.</p>
","<p>What probably happens is that during instantiation and initialization it's not guaranteed that properties are initialized in the same order as you have defined them in the code, so you cannot initialize a property with a value retrieved from another property.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to move the property initializations in the <code>init()</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1</strong>: as suggested by @Yatheesha, it's correct to say that <code>self</code> is not available <em>until</em> all properties have been initialized - see ""Two-Phase Initialization"" paragraph in the swift book, under ""Initialization""</p>

<p>In this line (as well as in the ones after it):</p>

<pre><code>let screenWidth = screenRect.width;
</code></pre>

<p>you are implicitly using <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>So the correct way is to use <code>init()</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>let screenRect: CGRect
let screenWidth: NSNumber
let screenHeight: NSNumber
let screenX: NSNumber
let screenY: NSNumber

init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder!) {
    let bounds = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds
    screenRect = bounds
    screenWidth = bounds.width
    screenHeight = bounds.height
    screenX = bounds.origin.x
    screenY = bounds.origin.y

    super.init(coder:aDecoder)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if there is more than one designated <code>init()</code>, you have to replicate that code on each. In that case it might be better to use @Andy's approach, using computed properties, if you prefer to avoid code duplication.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2</strong></p>

<p>Another obvious way (and probably the best one) is to avoid using <code>self</code> at all:</p>

<pre><code>let screenRect: CGRect = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds
let screenWidth = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width;
let screenHeight = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.height;
let screenX = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.origin.x
let screenY = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.origin.y

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zdByI.png"" alt=""new particle file""></p>

<p>You'd then load the particle file in to a new <code>SKEmitterNode</code> like so:</p>

  if flag {
    var aaa: A

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am getting an error:</p>

<pre><code>'A' is not convertible to 'T'
</code></pre>
","<p>The type you are looking for is called an ""Either,"" and it's easily created in Swift using enums. For example:</p>

<pre><code>protocol A {}
protocol B {}

enum AorB {
  case IsA(A)
  case IsB(B)
}

func newObject(flag: Bool) -&gt; AorB {
  if flag {
    return .IsA(...create an A...)
  } else {
    return .IsB(...create a B...)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When creating something like this, you should think very carefully about what your types really mean. What is <code>AorB</code> really? It is possible to create a generic holder for this by creating <code>Either&lt;Left,Right&gt;</code> (and that's common in some languages), but in many cases there are better names to give to this enum (like <code>Success</code> and <code>Failure</code> or <code>Local</code> and <code>Remote</code>). When your types read cleanly, your program is more likely correct.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that Swift does support return overloading. For example:</p>

<pre><code>typealias A = String
typealias B = Int

func newObject() -&gt; A {
  return ""a""
}

func newObject() -&gt; B {
  return 1
}

let x:A = newObject()
</code></pre>

<p>This should be used carefully, however, since it can be pretty awkward for the caller (of course, so is passing a flagâ¦). It makes more sense for functions that are likely to be chained in ways that make type-inference work. In my opinion, if you have a Boolean that flips between two behaviors, what you really have are two functions, and you should strongly lean towards naming them different things.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a full working example. The unfortunate <code>Box</code> type is a workaround for Beta5. The compiler hasn't yet implemented the ability to store an arbitrary-sized generic object in an enum. It has to know the size at compile time. So we get that with <code>Box</code>, which has a known size because it just holds an <code>[]</code> (which is what's really boxing for us). By v1 of Swift, you should be able to drop out the <code>Box</code> wrapper entirely.</p>

<pre><code>protocol A {
  class func create() -&gt; Self
}

class SomethingA : A {
  class func create() -&gt; SomethingA { println(""making A""); return SomethingA() }
}

protocol B {
  class func instantiate() -&gt; Self
}

class SomethingB : B {
  class func instantiate() -&gt; SomethingB { println(""making B""); return SomethingB() }
}

// Box is because of unimplemented compiler features in beta 5.
struct Box&lt;A&gt; {
  private let box: [A]
  init(_ value: A) { self.box = [value] }
  var value:A { return self.box[0] }
}

enum Either&lt;L,R&gt; {
  case Left(Box&lt;L&gt;)
  case Right(Box&lt;R&gt;)
}

800,25218610,0,1,swift,Core Data: Extend Predicate to fetch related entities with special Attribute-Value,"<p>I've got 2 entities (1 to many), both with a boolean flag ""visible""</p>

<p>To fetch all visible Entities of A i use</p>

<pre><code>request.predicate = NSPredicate(format:""visible != false"")
</code></pre>

<p>This way I get all visible A filled with all B (including the non visible)</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is it possible to extend the predicate to fetch all visible A filled only with all visible Entities of B?
Or do I have to loop through all Entities?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>[Update 1]</strong> Here is some code:</p>

<pre><code>class A: NSManagedObject {
    @NSManaged var visible: NSNumber
    @NSManaged var relationShipToB: NSSet
}
class B: NSManagedObject {
    @NSManaged var visible: NSNumber
    @NSManaged var relationShipToA: NSManagedObject
}

<p><strong>[Update 2]</strong> This is how my workaround looks like (in Swift)</p>

<pre><code>class A: NSManagedObject {
    @NSManaged var visible: NSNumber
    @NSManaged var relationShipToB: NSSet
    var visibleB:[B] {
        get {

                }
            }
            return result
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Update 3]</strong>
Lets say we have following instances:</p>

<pre><code>A1 {
    visible = ""true""
    toB = [B1, B2]
}

A2 {
    visible = ""true""
    toB = [B3]
}

B1 {
    visible = ""true""
}

B2 {
    visible = ""false""
}

B3 {
    visible = ""false""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Expected result:</p>

<pre><code>A1 [B1]
A2 []
</code></pre>

<p>As the result of my request I want to get <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em> (both are visible).
But as an containing <em>A1.toB</em> I <strong>only</strong> want to have <em>B1</em> (<em>B2</em> is not visible)
And <em>A2.toB</em> will be emty, because <em>B3</em> is not visible.</p>
","<p>You may try the following code...</p>

<pre><code>request.predicate = NSPredicate(format:""visible != false &amp;&amp; ANY toB.visible != false"")
</code></pre>

<p>... where <code>toB</code> is the name of the one-to-many relationship between A and B.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Using NSExpression subquery expressions (<a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSExpression_Class/Reference/NSExpression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">see Apple documentation</a>), you can write the equivalent of the previous predicate like this:</p>

<pre><code>fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""visible != false &amp;&amp; (SUBQUERY(toB, $x, $x.visible != false).@count != 0)"")
</code></pre>

<p>Those two predicates will allow you to find visible A files that have at least one visible related B managedObject.</p>

<p>If you want to fetch A managedObjects that only have visible related B managedObjects, you can use the predicate given to us by @Shmidt:</p>

<pre><code>request.predicate = NSPredicate(format:""visible != false &amp;&amp; ALL toB.visible != false"")
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem there is that Core Data projects based on SQLite (NSSQLiteStoreType Persistent Store Type) can't use predicates that contain ""ALL"": it generates a compile time error like the one you get (<a href=""http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2009/Jun/msg01982.html"" rel=""nofollow"">see this old post from Melissa Turner</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately, using once more NSExpression subquery expressions, you can write an (ugly) equivalent of this previous predicate that will work for Core Data SQLite based projects:</p>

<pre><code>fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""visible != false &amp;&amp; (SUBQUERY(toB, $x, $x.visible != false).@count == toB.@count)"")

","<p>The reason why you're change fixed it is because of Apple's ""safe"" approach to this language. Any non-wrapped and non-initialized variables that aren't initialized before a method call will throw a compiler error. It's a safety feature in Swift. Basically, the compiler is trying to save you from doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>init(name: String, sideLength: Double){            
    super.init(name: name)
    someFunctionThatUsesSideLengthBeforeItsInitialized(sideLength)
    self.sideLength = sideLength
    numberOfSide = 4
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method <code>someFunctionThatUsesSideLengthBeforeItsInitialized</code> might cause a exception. In my opinion, super-class functions like <code>super.init</code> should be exempt from this rule.</p>

Since we've already made sure that <code>section</code> is within the bounds of <code>collection.keys</code>, we can forcibly unwrap <code>collection[key]!</code> when we get its <code>count</code>.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I also made a generic function that takes a collection as input to generalize things:</p>

851,25350560,1,1,swift,Swift Dictionary lookup causing compile-time error,"<p>I'm dipping my toe into Swift, but have run into an issue that has me slightly confused. Given an integer index I'm trying to fetch the corresponding key of a Dictionary and return the value associated with it.</p>

<p>Using the following structure as an example:</p>

<pre><code>Class CustomClass {
    private var collection: [String: [SifterIssue]] = [""MyStringKey"": [MyCustomCollectionClass]()]

    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to solve the problem like so:</p>

<pre><code>var keys = Array(self.collection.keys)
var key: String = keys[section] as String
return self.collection[key].count // error is flagged here
</code></pre>

<p>But found that this results in a compiler error, which states that <strong>'String' is not convertible to 'DictionaryIndex'</strong>. Stumped, I tried a slightly more verbose solution and was surprised to find that this compiled and worked without issue. </p>

<pre><code>var keys = Array(self.collection.keys)
var key: String = keys[section] as String
var collection: [MyCustomCollectionClass] = self.collection[key]! as [MyCustomCollectionClass]
return issues.count
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone explain to me why the first solution refuses to compile?</p>
","<p>Ignoring the fatal potential error is a really bad idea. The whole reason for Optionals is to prevent crashes at runtime.</p>

<pre><code>func collectionCount(#section: Int) -&gt; Int? {
    var keys = Array(self.collection.keys)
    if section &lt; keys.count {
    var key = keys[section] as String
        println(""key: \(key)"")
        return self.collection[key]!.count
    }
    else {
        // handle error here
        return nil
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Throwing in ""!"" unwrapping without knowing that the value can <strong>never</strong> be nil is much worse than the Objective-C handling of nil. If this becomes the standard way of handling Optionals by a substantial number of developers Swift will be a disaster. Please do not do this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Double</code> represents a 64-bit floating-point number. Use it when

<p>but then later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swift always chooses <code>Double</code> (rather than <code>Float</code>) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn't this a bit of a contradiction? Won't 64-bit precision be excessive for <em>most</em> floating-point numbers? And does this mean that I should be explicit about defining Float numbers as such, or does the difference not really matter in practice?</p>
","<p>Defaulting to <code>Double</code> gives the guarantee that no floating-point precision errors will be caused by the type inference.</p>

<p>Defaulting to <code>Float</code> would cause troubles in some instances, so I'd say this is a conservative choice.</p>

322,24162170,0,1,swift,How to use NSMaxXEdge in Cocoa app with Swift (Xcode 6)?,"<p>I've tried to create a Cocoa app which uses <code>NSPopover</code> internally. One of the popover's method is <code>showRelativeToRect: ofView: preferredEdge:</code>, which triggers an popover in Cocoa app.</p>

<p>If you use Objective-C in Xcode 5.1, you can execute the method with the method above, like this:</p>

<pre><code>[popover showRelativeToRect: sender.bounds ofView: sender preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge];
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I tried to use the method in Swift in Xcode 6, the message <code>Use of unresolved identifier 'NSMaxXEdge'</code> was shown when I wrote the following method, which is just a rewrite of the Objective-C method above:</p>

<pre><code>popover.showRelativeToRect(sender.bounds, ofView: sender, preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge
</code></pre>

<p>So where is the <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> gone? The official documentation says it is of type <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but what is the <code>NSRectEdge</code>? The doc doesn't link to <code>NSRectEdge</code> page.</p>

<p>Also, Xcode 5 documentation also says it is <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but again, no link exists there. So how can I know about what it is all about?</p>

<p>And finally, if <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> is no longer available in Xcode 6, what is the alternative?</p>
","<p>(The below is true for beta 5 (developing for 10.9). Your mileage may vary.)</p>

<p>Above, you get a solution that works - passing 0-3 where the function calls for a NSRectEdge. I'd like to pick up on </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how can I know about what it is all about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation indicates that NSRectEdge is bridged with CGRectEdge, but trying to pass in CGRectEdge led to an error of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CGRectEdge is not convertible to NSRectEdge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NSRectEdge.from(2) or NSRectEdge(2) - as suggested above - come back with the error that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSRectEdge has no accessible initializers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you type NSRectEdge into Xcode, however, it shows two types:
CGRectEdge (which in this case is useless, see above) and Int.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that you need to guess that NSRectEdge is an enum when you see it both called as a string and defined as an int; but from there to looking up its definition in the framework is a logical step; as is guessing that you will have four values, one for each edge.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there seems to be an internal modulo operation going on somewhere - when you pass it '4', you get NSMinXEdge again and so on.</p>

<p>If you run that in playground, the last line will print <code>Closure executed</code>.</p>

<p>The reason why a <code>NSArray</code> doesn't work is that it is bridged as an array of <code>AnyObject</code> in swift - but <code>AnyObject</code> is <em>an instance of any class type</em>, and obviously a closure is <em>not</em> a class.</p>

<p>As for removing an item from an array, that's a more complicated issue. <code>find</code> cannot be used because it requires the array type to implement the <code>Equatable</code> protocol, but closures don't implement it, and they cannot be extended. </p>

<p>Maybe rather than using an array you can use a dictionary, with a key type that makes sense for you depending on your app logic - such as a textual name, an enum, etc. For example, if you use an enum:</p>

<pre><code>enum ClosureEnum {
    case TEST_ELEMENT
}

var dict = [ClosureEnum:ClosureType]()
dict[.TEST_ELEMENT] = someClosure
dict[.TEST_ELEMENT]!()
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>!</code> in <code>dict[.TEST_ELEMENT]!()</code>, required because a lookup in a dictionary always return an optional. You can use forced unwrapping like that, or enclose it in an optional binding for safer code.</p>

<p>To remove an element, just use the proper method:</p>

","<p>In Core Data you would model this kind of relationship with a many-to-many relationship, not a separate join table.</p>

<pre><code>Station (programs) &lt;&lt;-----&gt;&gt; (stations) Program

989,25740900,2,1,swift,How to dynamically increase and decrease UILabel's text smoothly as font size varies ios,"<p>I have tried searching this functionality but didn't solved my problem.</p>

<p>What I Want:  I have a UILabels text as ""attended"" with initial font size of 28 (totally four labels with different fonts sizes and texts). Now I vary slider (which is placed in the bottom), I will send the font size to be increased or increased. Now, i want to not only change the font size but also UILabel frame like  </p>

<pre><code>self.labelAttendCount.frame = CGRectMake(40 + (diff * 0.7) , 110 - (diff * 0.3), 40 - diff/5, 30 - (diff * 0.3))
self.labelAttendCount.font = UIFont(name: ""ArialMT"", size: round(28 - (diff * 0.28)))
</code></pre>

<p>Everything goes fine but, when its position is changing its jerky (or shaky). I want this to be dealt smoothly.</p>

<p>refer to this link where there is smooth increase or decrease in label size.     <a href=""http://macoscope.com/blog/ios-7-dynamic-type-simulator-for-designers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macoscope.com/blog/ios-7-dynamic-type-simulator-for-designers/</a></p>

<p>Hope u understand my question.</p>

<p>Please check this shared video link  (removed link)</p>

<p>This solution might be usefull for some one. </p>

<p>Finally got a Solution to shrink UILabel or UIButton Text and change their position: </p>

<p>Make UILabels as subview to UIView. </p>

<pre><code>    viewLeft.addsubView(labelAttendedCount)
</code></pre>

<p>later</p>

<pre><code>    viewLeft.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1 - (diff * 0.01), 1 - (diff * 0.01)) // to shrink viewLeft UIView
        viewLeft.frame = CGRectMake(25 + (diff * 0.8), 110 - (diff * 0.3), 100 , 50 - diff/2) // to move the ViewLeft and diff is increase in the contentoffset or UIPanGesture location.y
        viewLeft.center = CGPointMake(25 + viewLeft.frame.width/2 + (diff * 0.8), viewLeft.frame.origin.y + viewLeft.frame.height/2)  // To adjust the position of the UIView.
</code></pre>
","<p>Instead of changing the font size, you can just use UIView's transform, e.g</p>

<pre><code>self.labelAttendCount.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1.5, 1.5);

One of these view controllers is set up so that when you select an item from a TableView It goes to a different ViewController that is not on the TabBarController. My problem arises when I want to go back from the ViewController that is not segued to the TabBarController.

If I set up a segue going back to the TabBarController it shows the TabBar but it goes back to the first tab (which is definitely not what I want). Is there a way to tell it to go to the third tab or a specific ViewController? Or just create a segue directly back to the ViewController I want and have the tab bar appear.</p>

println(savedScore)

1045,25912670,1,1,swift,Swift - Closure in Dictionary Crash,"<p>So I had objc code which uses Singleton instance to make pings(using SimplePing) and holds ping request completion blocks. In ObjC it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface SimplePingClient()
{
    NSMutableArray* _currentPings;
    NSMutableDictionary* _currentCallbacks;
}

@end

@implementation SimplePingClient

-(id)init
{
    if( self = [super init] )
    {
        _currentPings = [NSMutableArray new];
        _currentCallbacks = [NSMutableDictionary new];
    }

    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>method to start ping:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)pingHostname:(NSString*)hostName andResultCallBlock:(void(^)(NSString* latency))result
{
    TSimplePing* pingClient = [TSimplePing simplePingWithHostName:hostName];
    [_currentPings addObject:pingClient];
    [_currentCallbacks setObject:result forKey:[NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:pingClient]];
    pingClient.delegate = self;
    //some other irrelevant code
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when SimplePing delegate method is called:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)simplePing:(TSimplePing *)pinger didReceivePingResponsePacket:(NSData *)packet
{
    void(^callback)(NSString* latency) = [_currentCallbacks objectForKey:[NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:pinger]];
    if( callback )
    {
        //some irrelevant code
        ...
        callback(@""123"");//hard coded for test, irrelevant code get this value correctly ;)
        [_currentCallbacks removeObjectForKey:[NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:pinger]];
    }
    [_currentPings removeObject:pinger];
}
</code></pre>

<p>So this code work flawlessly on objc. However when I try to port this in Swift I keep get error EXC_BAD_ACCESS. To simplify example I just erased everything and it turns out that storing Closure in Dictionary and immediately call it is not working for me:</p>

<pre><code>typealias callbackClosure = (String) -&gt; ()

class SimplePingClient: NSObject
{
    // MARK: variables
    var _currentPings = [TSimplePing]()
    var _currentCallbacks: Dictionary&lt;String, callbackClosure&gt; = [String: callbackClosure]()

    private func ping(hostname: String, resultCallback:callbackClosure)
    {
        var pingClient = TSimplePing(hostName: hostname)
        pingClient.delegate = self
        _currentPings.append(pingClient)
        _currentCallbacks[pingClient.hostName] = resultCallback

        if let callback = _currentCallbacks[pingClient.hostName]
        {
            callback(""123213"")//here program CRASHES
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in code I even try using hostname(which is String) instead of NSValue assuming some memory problems, but it's not the case - still crashing. This error however is surely something with memory management, however I cannot understand what I'm doing wrong. If anyone could point me what I'm missing I'll really apreciate it.</p>
","<p>As @Owen Hartnett suggested I'm moving solution from answer itself here:</p>

<p>Okay, after another hour of debugging it turns out reason is pretty silly. As I said I'm porting my code, so previously I was using this class as bridged objective-c code, therefore this function:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)pingHostname:(NSString*)hostName andResultCallBlock:(void(^)(NSString* latency))result
</code></pre>

<p>was bridged following way:</p>

<pre><code>SimplePingClient.pingHostname(latencyUrl, refreshTime: refreshRate) { (latency: String!) -&gt; () in

   if nil != latency
   {
       //dummy code
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>therefore after SimplePingClient became swift class, my new closure signature is(note that now latency is not force unwrapped and is not optional, and also no need to check against nil)</p>

<pre><code>SimplePingClient.pingHostname(latencyUrl, refreshTime: refreshRate) { (latency: String) -&gt; () in

       //dummy code

    }
</code></pre>

<p>So by simply changing method call everything started working. Strange thing that compiler doesn't notice this problem though.</p>

","<p>Something in the <code>self.view.window.backgroundColor</code> chain (probably <code>self.view.window</code>) is nil.

Unfortunately, if you try to access one when it's nil you get the runtime error you're seeing.</p>

321,24162170,4,1,swift,How to use NSMaxXEdge in Cocoa app with Swift (Xcode 6)?,"<p>I've tried to create a Cocoa app which uses <code>NSPopover</code> internally. One of the popover's method is <code>showRelativeToRect: ofView: preferredEdge:</code>, which triggers an popover in Cocoa app.</p>

<p>If you use Objective-C in Xcode 5.1, you can execute the method with the method above, like this:</p>

<pre><code>[popover showRelativeToRect: sender.bounds ofView: sender preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge];
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I tried to use the method in Swift in Xcode 6, the message <code>Use of unresolved identifier 'NSMaxXEdge'</code> was shown when I wrote the following method, which is just a rewrite of the Objective-C method above:</p>

<pre><code>popover.showRelativeToRect(sender.bounds, ofView: sender, preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge
</code></pre>

<p>So where is the <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> gone? The official documentation says it is of type <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but what is the <code>NSRectEdge</code>? The doc doesn't link to <code>NSRectEdge</code> page.</p>

<p>Also, Xcode 5 documentation also says it is <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but again, no link exists there. So how can I know about what it is all about?</p>

<p>And finally, if <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> is no longer available in Xcode 6, what is the alternative?</p>
","<p>In <code>Foundation/NSGeometary.h</code> of 10.10 SDK:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
    NSMinXEdge = 0,
    NSMinYEdge = 1,
    NSMaxXEdge = 2,
    NSMaxYEdge = 3  
} NSRectEdge;
</code></pre>

<p>So it should be <code>NSRectEdge.from(2)</code> or <code>NSRectEdge(2)</code> or just pass <code>2</code> will be fine.</p>

<p>If you try this:</p>

<pre><code>    println(""NSRectEdge.max: \(NSRectEdge.max)"")         // 9223372036854775807
    println(""NSRectEdge.from(2): \(NSRectEdge.from(2))"") // 2
    println(""NSRectEdge(2): \(NSRectEdge(2))"")           //2

319,24158390,1,1,swift,How to conform to protocol in Swift?,"<p>I try to convert facebookSDK method to swift code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loginViewFetchedUserInfo:(FBLoginView *)loginView
                        user:`(id&lt;FBGraphUser&gt;)user {}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is with this:</p>

<pre><code>id&lt;FBGraphUser&gt;)user
</code></pre>
","<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> is in Objective-C: conforms to protocol</p>

<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> is in Swift for generics</p>

<hr>

<p>If you only want to conform that the type of user is id and conforms to the protocol FBGraphUser:</p>

<p>id is AnyObject in Swift.</p>

<p>You can use protocols as types in the declarations of variable names.</p>

<pre><code>func loginViewFetchedUserInfo&lt;T where T: AnyObject, T: FBGraphUser&gt;(loginView: FBLoginView, #user: T)
{
   ...
}
// use the # only if you want the call of the method to write 'user:'
</code></pre>

<h3>Using the method:</h3>

<p>That is even easier. First you need the object which has the method, let's call it <code>facebookObject</code>. Now, if you have a variable <code>myUser</code> with the type <code>AnyObject, FBGraphUser</code>. And a variable <code>myLoginView</code> of type <code>FBLoginView</code>. Then you call the method with</p>

<pre><code>facebookObject.loginViewFetchedUserInfo(loginView: myLoginView, user: myLoginView)
</code></pre>

<p>it could be that the <code>user:</code> is not required, since that is the normal pattern for methods.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can however do more with the <code>where</code> keyword</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <strong>where</strong> after the type name to specify a list of requirementsâfor example, to require the type to implement a protocol, to require two types to be the same, or to require a class to have a particular superclass.</p>

","<p>I believe you meant to declare that method as <code>static</code>.  Seeing as the enum can't have any public constructors, it makes no sense to invoke instance methods on the type rather than one of its cases.</p>

320,24162170,0,1,swift,How to use NSMaxXEdge in Cocoa app with Swift (Xcode 6)?,"<p>I've tried to create a Cocoa app which uses <code>NSPopover</code> internally. One of the popover's method is <code>showRelativeToRect: ofView: preferredEdge:</code>, which triggers an popover in Cocoa app.</p>

<p>If you use Objective-C in Xcode 5.1, you can execute the method with the method above, like this:</p>

<pre><code>[popover showRelativeToRect: sender.bounds ofView: sender preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge];
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I tried to use the method in Swift in Xcode 6, the message <code>Use of unresolved identifier 'NSMaxXEdge'</code> was shown when I wrote the following method, which is just a rewrite of the Objective-C method above:</p>

<pre><code>popover.showRelativeToRect(sender.bounds, ofView: sender, preferredEdge: NSMaxXEdge
</code></pre>

<p>So where is the <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> gone? The official documentation says it is of type <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but what is the <code>NSRectEdge</code>? The doc doesn't link to <code>NSRectEdge</code> page.</p>

<p>Also, Xcode 5 documentation also says it is <code>NSRectEdge</code>, but again, no link exists there. So how can I know about what it is all about?</p>

<p>And finally, if <code>NSMaxXEdge</code> is no longer available in Xcode 6, what is the alternative?</p>
","<p><code>NSRectEdge</code> has a static var called <code>max</code>. I think you should just use that. For example:</p>

<pre><code>popover.showRelativeToRect(rect, ofView: view, preferredEdge: NSRectEdge.max)

","<p>Take the constraints off to start with and re-run the application, you should see the map appear. Then use the Pin button in the design area to set the constraints. If you want it to fill the view set each vales to 0 and enable the I bar adjacent to each value. </p>

<p>Remember that Xcode 6 is in beta and can be a bit flakey. Also, you might want to confirm its your constraints, go to Debug > View Debugging > Capture View Hierarchy and turn the wireframe on to see where your view is ending up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Double</code> represents a 64-bit floating-point number. Use it when
  floating-point values must be very large or particularly precise.</p>
  
  <p><code>Float</code> represents a 32-bit floating-point number. Use it when

<p>but then later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swift always chooses <code>Double</code> (rather than <code>Float</code>) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn't this a bit of a contradiction? Won't 64-bit precision be excessive for <em>most</em> floating-point numbers? And does this mean that I should be explicit about defining Float numbers as such, or does the difference not really matter in practice?</p>
","<p>Why floating point numbers are inferred as <code>Double</code> could be due:</p>

<p>1) Many other languages like JAVA and Haskell infer floating point as <code>Double</code></p>

<p>2) <code>Double</code>, with the higher precision, ensure that the precision is not lost. They have made the decision towards keeping the precision, over potential performance improvements (lower memory) that may be seen while using <code>Float</code>.</p>

","<p><code>player</code> in your loop is an instance of <code>Dictionary&lt;String, AnyObject&gt;</code>. So values stored in that dictionary are instances of <code>AnyObject</code>.</p>

<p>In this line:</p>

<p>you are trying to make an implicit cast from <code>AnyObject</code> to <code>Int</code>, which is not possible. The correct way to handle that is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unwrap the value extracted from the dictionary (it can be <code>nil</code> if the key doesn't exist)</li>
<li>explicitly cast to <code>Int</code></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>let id = player[""id""]! as Int

<p>Similar rules apply for <code>score</code> and <code>name</code></p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong> - as per your last error, probably it is caused by the fact that a key is not in the dictionary. Try using optionals like this:</p>

let score = (player[""score""] as AnyObject?) as? Int
let name = (player[""name""] as AnyObject?) as? String

<p>You have 3 optional variables, which get <code>nil</code> if the corresponding expression at the right side evaluates to <code>nil</code>. If that works, use the debugger to check which key is not in the dictionary</p>

But I still think it's a bug; it's as if the notion of comparing an array of optional NSURLs causes Swift to throw up its hands somehow... And, one might argue, it's a bug in another sense too, because I explicitly typed these arrays as <code>NSURL[]</code>; I didn't say <code>NSURL?[]</code>, so why is Swift permitting an Optional to go into them in the first place?</p>

It looks like you want to create content, have it move then remove it from the scene. You might be better off just creating a few sprites, saving a reference to them then having them appear, move and disappear whenever you need it. That would be safer. </p>

449,24358030,3,1,swift,How can I create a setter for a UIScrollView generated from the storyboard using Swift?,"<p>Using interface builder, I dragged out a UIScrollView onto my ImageViewController.</p>

<p>I control-dragged from the ScrollView onto my ImageViewController to get an IBOutlet to control the scrollView. Which added the code:</p>

<pre><code>@IBOutlet var scrollView : UIScrollView
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to set a property on the scrollView right after it is initialized. </p>

<p>In objective C you would write this function to achieve it:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)setScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
{
  _scrollView = scrollView
  self.scrollView.contentSize = self.image ? self.image.size : CGSizeZero;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would set the contentSize on the scroll view right after it has been initialized. </p>

<p>Currently in Swift I am achieving similar functionality by wrapping the self.scrollView inside a new var with a get function like so:</p>

<pre><code>var sgScrollView: UIScrollView
{
    get {
        self.scrollView.contentSize = self.image!.size
        return self.scrollView!
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then instead of using this code in viewDidLoad:</p>

<pre><code>self.scrollView.addSubview(self.imageView)
</code></pre>

<p>I use this:</p>

<pre><code>self.sgScrollView.addSubview(self.imageView)
</code></pre>

<p>Which sets the content size upon getting the scrollView. </p>

<p>But in the objective C tutorial I am following they set the content size of the scrollView right after it has been initialized and set, like the obj-c function above. How can I do that using Swift? </p>
","<p>This would be a great place to use Swift's <em>property observers</em>. You can define <code>willSet</code> and <code>didSet</code> observers on any property in your class. You'd want a <code>didSet</code> observer for this:</p>

<pre><code>class ImageViewController : ViewController {
    var image : UIImage?
    @IBOutlet var scrollView : UIScrollView {
    didSet {
        self.scrollView.contentSize = self.image?.size ?? CGSizeZero
    }
    }

    ...
}

","<pre><code>var arr = defaults.arrayForKey(""kWeeks"") as [WeekReport]?

<p>Is doing a forced casting to an optional array of <code>WeekReport</code>. Instead, you really want to do an optional casting:</p>

    arr.append(report)
    defaults.setObject(arr, forKey: ""kWeeks"")

<p>This says, ""if there is an array for ""kWeeks"" that can be cast to an array of <code>WeekReport</code>, do the following with it as <code>arr</code>""</p>

","<p><code>@IBOutlet var companyName : UILabel</code> is an outlet , if you call  <code>var vc = SearchTableViewController(style: UITableViewStyle.Plain)</code> The outlet <strong>companyName</strong> label is not initialised , therefore it is nil , therefore accessing <strong>companyName</strong> label causes crash. </p>

<p>But in the first case you are initialising viewController from storyboard which is having <strong>SearchTableViewController</strong> scene contains  <strong>CompanyTableViewCell</strong> with outlet <strong>companyName</strong>  and it is connected to Cell ,hence it is initialised , there fore it works as expected.</p>

<p>Solution is : </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your are using storyBoard use <code>instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:</code> method to initialise viewController(assuming that <strong>SearchTableViewController</strong> has <strong>CompanyTableViewCell</strong> in the storyboard).</p></li>

<p>Is there a different or better way to do this, or is this about right?</p>

<p>Thanks so much! </p>
","<p>There are two elegant ways to this effectively and clearly.</p>

<p>1)You can use different <code>xib</code> for each 3 views and on runtime load appropriate <code>xib</code> of the different views.This approch should used if you have small and clear views.There is not much work need to handle like <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delgations</code>.The three views will manage by only one view controller.<strong>It will make all your views separate and easily managable</strong>.You can load diffrent views as</p>

<pre><code>//Your view property
var uiview :UIView?
//load nib from bundle in view    
self.uiview = NSBundle.mainBundle().loadNibNamed(""myXib"", owner: self, options: nil)[0] as? UIView
</code></pre>

<p>2)Use <code>container viewcontroller</code>.By doing this you can add the different controllers to your parent controller.This approach is very clean as different views are handled by differnt controllers but it is hard to write.Use this if you have heavy work need to do by each view.See WWDC video to get more help <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/?id=102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/?id=102</a></p>

<p>I think in your case <code>1st</code> approach is appropriate use the three different xib and load it on runtime and add as <code>subview</code> of your <code>viewController</code></p>

704,25025890,1,1,swift,Performance UICellView with Subviews,"<p>i have a general Question about the Performance of some Custom TableViewCells.</p>

<p>I have 5 different Cells, everyone with a different ReUseIdentifier. That all works fine. Now i need to add a Label on some Cells (its programmatically, and it could be for all of the 5 different Cells).</p>

<p>For Exampe i have now 100 Rows, 20 of each Type and i need to add a Label in the Subview for 10 of the 100 Rows.</p>

<p>It is now better to add the Label programmatically to the Subview of the specific rows, or should i create for 5 different Cells a Label and hide it by default (and use it if needed)</p>

<p>Thanks in Advance</p>
","<p>The difference between adding a subview and unhiding a view or removing a subview and hiding a view is probably not very noticeable.</p>

<p>But from an organizational standpoint, the label should either be added in IB and hidden/unhidden appropriately OR a method for adding the label should be added to the cell, so the cell adds the label itself when this method is called rather than the tableview data source adding the label (and then being responsible for removing it).  If you're adding a subview though, don't forget to remove it in the cell's <code>prepareForReuse</code> method.</p>

<p>You <em>might</em> pass nil here, because <em>any</em> object reference could be nil. So the return value is <em>typed</em> as an unwrapped optional. In reality, you just pass the table view cell object.</p>

<p><strong>The Incoming Table View</strong></p>

<p>It <em>might</em> be nil, because <em>any</em> object reference could be nil, but in fact you know it won't be. It is unwrapped implicitly for you, so in reality you can just use it as a table view. </p>

<ol>
<li>Installed xcode6 beta</li>
<li>Installed iOS 7.1 simulator from Xcode6->Preferences->Downloads</li>
<li>Now, I created a new iOS Application Master Detail project and selected swift as language</li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

","<p>The Master-Detail Xcode project template creates a storyboard with a <code>UISplitViewController</code> as the root view controller.</p>

488,24451960,5,1,swift,Optional chaining and Array in swift,"<p>Let's take these two simple classes to show my problem:</p>

<pre><code>class Object{  
    var name:String?
    // keep it simple... and useless
}

class TestClass {
    var objects:AnyObject[]? 

    func initializeObjects (){
        objects?.insert(Object(), atIndex:0) // Error
        objects?.insert(Object(), atIndex:1) // Error
        objects?.insert(Object(), atIndex:2) // Error
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this implementation I get 3 errors <code>Could not find member 'insert'</code> where I try to add object into the <code>objects</code> array.</p>

<p>Now, if I remove the optional from <code>objects</code> definition and the optional chain in <code>initializeObjects</code> it works with no problem (here the working code) </p>

<pre><code>class Object{
    var name:String?
}

class TestClass {
    var objects:AnyObject[] = AnyObject[]() // REMOVE optional and initialize an empty array

    func initializeObjects (){
        objects.insert(Object(), atIndex:0) // Remove Opt chaining 
        objects.insert(Object(), atIndex:1) // Remove Opt chaining
        objects.insert(Object(), atIndex:2) // Remove Opt chaining
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't understand what is wrong in the first implementation. 
I thought it checks with <code>objects?</code> if <code>objects</code> is not <code>nil</code> and at this point it adds an element using <code>insert:atIndex:</code>. But I'm probably wrong -.- </p>
","<p>Arrays in Swift are structs and structs are value types.<br>
Optionals in Swift are actually enums (<code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>When you are unwrapping an optional (implicitly or explicitly) of a value type, what you get is actually a constant copy of the struct. And you can't call <code>mutating</code> methods on a constant struct.</p>

<p>Executing <code>objects?.insert(Object(), atIndex:0)</code> basically means this:</p>

<pre><code>if let tmp = objects {
    tmp.insert(Object(), atIndex:0)
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a workaround, you need to assign the unwrapped value to a variable and then assign the variable back to your optional property. That's how value types work.</p>

<p>This is reproducible for any struct, not only Arrays:</p>

<pre><code>struct S {
    var value: Int = 0
}

var varS: S = S()
varS.value = 10 //can be called

let constS: S = S()
constS.value = 10 //cannot be called - constant!

var optionalS: S? = S()
optionalS?.value = 10 //cannot be called, unwrapping makes a constant copy!

//workaround
if optionalS {
    var tmpS = optionalS!
    tmpS.value = 10
    optionalS = tmpS
}

<pre><code>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
willFinishLaunchingWithOptions

<p>And when the application is opened while in the background from any of these three scenarios:</p>

<p>1.) Double clicking the home button and selecting the app window
2.) Clicking the app icon from the springboard
3.) Opening the application from a UILocalNotification click</p>

<p>This fires:</p>

<pre><code>applicationWillEnterForeground
</code></pre>
","<p>That is the difference between <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> and <code>applicationDidBecomeActive:</code>.</p>

<p><code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> is only called when the application is starting new.</p>

<p><code>applicationDidBecomeActive:</code> will be called when the app is becoming active again from the background. <strong>Note</strong>: <code>applicationDidBecomeActive:</code> is called on first launch as well. If you need to differentiate between the two cases, you have to do so using <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code>. You could set a local variable to track if it was launched for the first time.</p>

781,25197960,3,1,swift,Segue crashes my program. Has something to do with my NavigationController and my TabBarViewController,"<p>I encountered a problem while testing my app. You can see how I have setup my views in the following image:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/HJCQZ.png"" alt=""My StoryBoard setup""></p>

<p>The thing is that everything works fine. I user my test user to login, and the following code executes the loginSegue, </p>

<pre><code>self.performSegueWithIdentifier(""loginSegue"", sender: self)
</code></pre>

<p>which is a modal segue that links my login ""View Controller"" with the ""Home Tab Bar View Controller"". I get redirected to the ""Initial Feed View Controller"". Everything works great. But when I go to my ""Settings View Controller"", and click on the Logout button, which has the following code (IBAction):</p>

<pre><code>@IBAction func logoutAction(sender: AnyObject) {

  PFUser.logOut()

  self.performSegueWithIdentifier(""logoutSegue"", sender: self)
}
</code></pre>

<p>my app crashes. My Logout button's action has a segue that takes you back to the login ""View Controller"", but logs the user out first (I am using Parse by the way). This ""Push"" segue is called logoutSegue. I tried to change the segue to be a ""Popover"" segue. That solves the issue, kinda, since by doing so it messes up my ""Registration View Controller"" since when in the login ""View Controller"" I click on the button ""Register"" and the app crashes anyways.</p>

<p>The compiler tells me that the following line of code is the one causing the error:</p>

<pre><code>self.performSegueWithIdentifier(""logoutSegue"", sender: self)
</code></pre>

<p>I do not understand why this is happening. I suppose that it has something to do with how I have my ""Navigation Controller"" and ""Home Tab Bar View Controller"" setup. Or maybe with Delegates?</p>

<p>Could you help me to fix this? It does not matter if you have an Objective-C approach, please feel free to suggest a solution and I can try to convert it from Objective-C to Swift.</p>

<p>Besides helping me fixing my issue, I was wondering if you know what is the difference between the type of Segues (Push, Modal, Popover, Replace) and when should I use each. I read Apple's documentation but I still don't understand it in its' entirety. </p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your advice and responses.</p>
","<p>You do not want to use a traditional segue to return to your login screen.  The normal segue types always create a new copy of the destination view controller.  Instead, you want to return control to the view controller that called you.</p>

<p>You need to set up an <strong>unwind segue</strong> on logout.  Here's how.</p>

<p>1) In the code for <code>ViewController</code> add this function:</p>

<pre><code>@IBAction func comeHereOnLogout(segue:UIStoryboardSegue) {
    println(""Yay, Logged Out!"")
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) Control-drag from the <code>view controller</code> icon at the top of your <code>Settings View Controller</code> to
the <code>exit</code> icon at the top of your <code>Settings View Controller</code> and choose <code>comeHereOnLogout</code> from the pop up that appears.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/C9D1N.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zhC1y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>Select that segue in the <em>Document Outline</em> and give it an <em>Identifier</em> in the <em>Attributes Inspector</em> such as ""logoutSegue"".</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4comj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AWqSi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then you can trigger this segue in code with:</p>

<pre><code>self.performSegueWithIdentifier(""logoutSegue"", sender: self)
</code></pre>

<p>3) Alternatively, you can wire the <code>unwind segue</code> from your <em>Logout</em> button to the <code>exit</code> icon at the top of your <code>Settings View Controller</code>.  In this case, this segue would replace your logout button action.  Again, you'd want to give this segue a name such as ""logoutSegue"".</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jKZBI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>In this case, you'd put your logout code in prepare for segue:</p>

<pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue!, sender: AnyObject!) {
    if segue.identifier == ""logoutSegue"" {
        PFUser.logOut()
    }
}

493,24456840,2,1,swift,Why NOT use optionals in Swift?,"<p>I was reading up on how to program in Swift, and the concept of optionals bugged me a little bit. Not really in terms of why to use optionals, that makes sense, but more so as to in what case would you not want to use optionals. From what I understand, an optional just allows an object to be set to nil, so why would you not want that feature? Isn't setting an object to nil the way you tell ARC to release an object? And don't most of the functions in Foundation and Cocoa return optionals? So outside of having to type an extra character each time to refer to an object, is there any good reason NOT to use an optional in place of a regular type? </p>
","<p>The original idea of optionals (which existed long before Swift) is to <em>force</em> programmer to check value for nil before using it â or to prevent outside code from passing nil where it is not allowed. A huge part of crashes in software, maybe even most of them, happens at address 0x00000000 (or with NullPointerException, or alike) precisely because it is way too easy to forget about nil-pointer scenario. (In 2009, Tony Hoare apologized for inventing null pointers).</p>

<p>Not using optionals is as valid and widespread use case as using them: when the value absolutely can not be missing, there should be non-optional type; when it can, there should be an optional.</p>

<p>But currently, the existing frameworks are written in Obj-C without optionals in mind, so automatically generated bridges between Swift and Obj-C just <em>have</em> to take and return optionals, because it is impossible to automatically deeply analyze each method and figure out which arguments and return values should be optionals or not. I'm sure over time Apple will manually fix every case where they got it wrong; right now you should not use those frameworks as an example, because they are definitely not a good one. (For good examples, you could check a popular functional language like Haskell which had optionals since the beginning).</p>
"
492,24456840,6,1,swift,Why NOT use optionals in Swift?,"<p>I was reading up on how to program in Swift, and the concept of optionals bugged me a little bit.

And don't most of the functions in Foundation and Cocoa return optionals? So outside of having to type an extra character each time to refer to an object, is there any good reason NOT to use an optional in place of a regular type? </p>
","<p>There are tons of reasons to NOT use optional. The main reason: You want to express that a value MUST be available. For example, when you open a file, you want the file name to be a string, not an optional string. Using <code>nil</code> as filename simply makes no sense.</p>

<p>I will consider two main use cases: Function arguments and function return values.</p>

<p>For function arguments, the following holds: If the argument needs to be provided, option should not be used. If handing in <em>nothing</em> is okay and a valid (documented!) input, then hand in an optional.</p>

<p>For function return values returning no optional is especially nice: You promise the caller that he will receive an object, not either an object or <em>nothing</em>. When you do not return an optional, the caller knows that he may use the value right away instead of checking for null first.</p>

<p>For example, consider a factory method. Such method should always return an object, so why should you use optional here? There are a lot of examples like this.</p>

<p>Actually, most APIs should rather use non-optionals instead of optionals. Most of the time, simply passing/receiving possibly <em>nothing</em> is just not what you want. There are rather few cases where nothing is an option.</p>

<p>Each case where optional is used must be thoroughly documented: In which circumstances will a method return nothing? When is it okay to hand nothing to a method and what will the consequences be? A lot of documentation overhead.</p>

<p>Then there is also conciseness: If you use an API that uses optional all over the place, your code will be cluttered with null-checks. Of course, if every use of optional is intentional, then these checks are fine and necessary. However, if the API only uses optional because its author was lazy and was simply using optional all over the place, then the checks are unnecessary and pure boilerplate.</p>

<h2>But beware!</h2>

<p>My answer may sound as if the concept of optionals is quite crappy. The opposite is true! By having a concept like optionals, the programmer is able to declare whether handing in/returning nothing is okay. The caller of a function is always aware of that and <strong>the compiler enforces safety</strong>. Compare that to plain old C: You could not declare whether a pointer could be <code>null</code>. You could add documentation comments that state whether it may be <code>null</code>, but such comments were not enforced by the compiler. If the caller forgot to check a return value for null, you received a segfault. With optionals you can be sure that noone dereferences a <code>null</code> pointer anymore.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, a null-safe type system is one of the major advances in modern programming languages.</p>

","<p><code>UITableView</code> follows the Model-View-Controller pattern. According to this pattern, all your changes need to be done to the model - in other words, to the data structure that stores the information from which you populate your cell data. Once you made the change to the model, you tell the view that the data has changed, which would then show the new data.</p>

<p>Let's say that your <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> function reads from an array. Your <code>imageSwiped</code> function should then locate the item that has been swiped, modify its entry in the array, and call either <code>reloadData</code> or <code>reloadRowsAtIndexPaths</code>.</p>

<p>That's it! Once you notify the table view of the reload, it would go back to the array, find the modified data, and call your <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> to display it.</p>

<p>Specifically, in your code add an array called <code>swipedCells</code> to the same class where you declared <code>tableData</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>var swipedCells = Boolean[](count:self.tableData.count, repeatedValue: false)
</code></pre>

<p>Now replace</p>

<pre><code>cell.testLabel.text = ""Test Label""
</code></pre>

<p>line with</p>

<pre><code>if self.swipedCells[indexPath.row] {
    cell.testLabel.text = ""Swiped!""
} else {
    cell.testLabel.text = ""Test Label""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, change the <code>imageSwiped</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>let indexPathRow = self.indexPathArray[recognizer.view.tag] as Int
self.swipedCells[indexPathRow] = true
self.tableView?.reloadData()
</code></pre>

<p>This way the cells that you have swiped would continue to have a label <code>""Swiped!""</code> even after you scroll.</p>

<p>The segue is not firing yet I believe I'm implemeting it as outlined in the workaround:</p>

<p>1) The View Controller header:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

@class DetailViewController;

@interface DetailViewController : UIViewController
- (IBAction) unwindToMaster:(UIStoryboardSegue *) segue;

    @IBOutlet var detailDescriptionLabel: UILabel
    var masterPopoverController: UIPopoverController? = nil

    @IBOutlet var itemButton: UIBarButtonItem

    @IBAction func unwindToMaster(segue:UIStoryboardSegue) {
        NSLog(""unwind baby"")
    }
[...]
}

                            &lt;connections&gt;

","<p><code>currencyCode</code> property of <code>currencyFormatter</code> is of type <code>String</code>. When you want to set it to the current locale currency code of your device, you have to use the following code:</p>

currencyFormatter.currencyCode = NSLocale.currentLocale().objectForKey(NSLocaleCurrencyCode) as String
println(currencyFormatter.currencyCode) //Will display ""USD"", for example

<p>However, as Guido Hendriks pointed out, <code>objectForKey:</code> returns <code>AnyObject?</code>. <em>The Swift Programming Language</em> recommends to use optional binding in order to unwrap safely optionals. Therefore, your code should look like the following:</p>

currencyFormatter.numberStyle = NSNumberFormatterStyle.CurrencyStyle
if let currencyCode = NSLocale.currentLocale().objectForKey(NSLocaleCurrencyCode) as? String {

    case Comments

 func selectedAction(action: NewsCellActionType) {
        self.cellDelegate?.newsCellDidSelectButton(self, actionType: action)
    }
}

<pre><code> override func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; UITableViewCell! {
        var cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(NewsCellsId) as NewsCell

    }

<p>It crash at the line cell.cellDelegate = self, I have no idea why. Is it a bug in the current DP, or am I doing it wrong?</p>

<p>I tried to use weak on my delegate var + the @objc tag on the protocol, but as I use a pure Swift enum I can't do that. But do I need it?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I needed two changes to make your code work</p>

<p><del>1. replaced <code>as</code> with <code>as?</code> after <code>tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier</code></del></p>

<p><del>(see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24022763/uitableview-in-swift"">UITableView in Swift</a> for more details)
</del></p>

<p>The first change not needed because the cell can't be <code>nil</code> (storyboard ensures it). I have built the code wrong.</p>

<p>2. Added <code>@class_protocol</code> to the <code>NewsCellDelegate</code></p>

<pre><code>@class_protocol protocol NewsCellDelegate {
</code></pre>

<p>I am not really sure why the app crashes without it and I think it's a bug. However, <code>@class_protocol</code> should be used anyway because we should declare the <code>cellDelegate</code> as <code>weak</code> and without <code>@class_protocol</code> we can't do it.</p>

<pre><code>weak var cellDelegate: NewsCellDelegate?
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, adding <code>weak</code> makes the app crash when the delegate is used.</p>

<p>There is an enourmous number of memory leaks in your code, starting with the library, which is written with ARC but it is set as MRC.</p>

<p>Your closures in <code>NewsCell</code> are capturing <code>self</code>, creating retain cycles (and subsequently leaked cells).</p>

<p>I wasn't able to find the reason of the crash but I am pretty sure it's a bug in the compiler/runtime because it is not only crashing the app, but also Xcode and 3 times it even crashed my system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default value is 0.0. The positive z axis is projected toward the
  viewer so that nodes with larger z values are closer to the viewer.
  When a node tree is rendered, the height of each node (in absolute
  coordinates) is calculated and then all nodes in the tree are rendered
  from smallest z value to largest z value. If multiple nodes share the
  same z position, those nodes are sorted so that parent nodes are drawn
  before their children, and siblings are rendered in the order that
  they appear in their parentâs children array. Hit-testing is processed
  in the opposite order.</p>
  
  <p>The SKView classâs ignoresSiblingOrder property controls whether node sorting is enabled for nodes at the same z position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you seem to want your <code>rect</code> node under your other nodes, and since the default <code>zPosition</code> is <code>0.0</code>, try setting it to <code>-1.0</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set any negative integer value to loop the sound indefinitely until you call the stop method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But your actual problem is almost certainly because you're stopping playback a little early: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stop method does not reset the value of the currentTime property to 0. In other words, if you call stop during playback and then call play, playback resumes at the point where it left off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's happening is that you're stopping the sound playback just a little before the actual end of the sampleâyour timer is set to just too short a time. The first time the timer is triggered, the ""play"" is playing the tiny amount of quiet or silent sound that's left at the end, and then stopping. The next time, the currentTime has been reset because the sample has successfully reached the end of playback, so on the <em>next</em> timer interval, after another 16 seconds, playback starts successfully from the beginning. And repeat.</p>

<p>As Jack observes in his comment, this is why there's a delegate callback to give you a kick when the playback has actually finished, but I'd still just set numberOfLoops and not bother with the complicated stuff, if you only need the sound to loop indefinitely.</p>

<p>(If you desperately want to repeat on your exact timer event, then just set currentTime to 0 before you play it again.)</p>

183,24060640,2,0,swift,Confused about behaviour of remainder operator in Swift,"<p>I am trying to calculate two random numbers constrained to a particular range using arc4random and the % operator.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PvtMA.png"" alt=""Issue with % operator""></p>

<p>I am not able to figure out why the compiler is complaining when calculating (x1,y1) when almost the same thing is done for x2,y2 except for using an int literal directly.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>The code sample is:</p>

<pre><code>import Darwin

let w1:Int = 223

// error: Could not find an overload for '%' that accepts the supplied arguments
let (x1,y1) =
(
  arc4random() % w1,
  arc4random() % 345
)




let (x2,y2) =
(
  arc4random() % 223,
  arc4random() % 345
)
</code></pre>
","<p>That's due to Swift's enforcement of type safety. </p>

<p><code>arc4random()</code> returns a <code>UInt32</code>, while you've declared <code>w</code> as an <code>Int</code>, so a compiler error is thrown. That'd also happen if you had tried to sum or divide <code>w</code> and the result of calling <code>arc4random()</code>, so the behaviour is not exclusive to the remainder operator.</p>

<p>You have a few options, depending on how you intend to use the resulting value of the operation.</p>

<p>You can declare w1 as an <code>UInt32</code> in the first place:</p>

<pre><code>var w1: UInt32 = 223
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can cast it to an <code>UInt32</code> before performing the remainder operation:</p>

<pre><code>arc4random() % UInt32(w1)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can initialize an <code>Int</code> from the result of the <code>arc4random()</code> call and use it with the Int version of <code>w1</code></p>

<pre><code>Int(arc4random()) % w1 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this behaviour does not apply to literals.</p>

<p>From the Apple provided iBook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rules for combining numeric constants and variables are different
  from the rules for numeric literals. The literal value 3 can be added
  directly to the literal value 0.14159, because number literals do not
  have an explicit type in and of themselves. Their type is inferred
  only at the point that they are evaluated by the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's why you don't see the same problem occur when doing <code>arc4random() % 345</code>.</p>

","<p>To me it looks like you're trying to send the <code>Arn.Preg:3302:</code> message and get a response before you've actually connected.

","<p>The problem is that since the <code>Array</code> class is actually a generic <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code>, you are extending <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code>. And apparently you can't cast between generic types (i.e. <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;Section&gt;</code>), so I believe you'll have to make a new array and just push the appropriate objects into it. </p>

<pre><code> 17&gt; extension Array {

 25.         return ary
 26.     }
 27. }

<p>You could also create a helper method to convert between generic types for you, but in this instance that would just create an unnecessary temporary object.</p>

<p>Remember that the language is still heavily in flux so it's possible this will change. I think it's unlikely that we'll get the ability to cast between generic types, but I hope we'll at least be able to extend particular generics.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Thanks again @rdelmar for your help.</p>

<p>I am having trouble getting the ' set the contentOffset of the collection view to (collection view width) * selectedRow' to work.</p>

<p>In my prepareForSegue function, I have added:</p>

<pre><code>  x = Float(indexPath.row) * 375.0
  var point = CGPointMake(CGFloat(x), 0)
  println (""***x="")
  println (x)
  detailController.collectionView?.setContentOffset(point , animated: false)

<p>and in the </p>

        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier(reuseIdentifier, forIndexPath: indexPath) as DetailViewCell

        // Configure the cell

        println(indexPath.row)

<p>Any idea to solve this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>There are a lot of different ways you could do this. One way would be to make your detail view controller's view be a collection view (with paging enabled), whose cells are the same size as the screen. You would need to pass in the array that you use to populate your table so the collection view could populate its cells. This would be quite efficient, since the collection view would only ever need to instantiate two cells.</p>

","<p>You don't have a nib file named <code>ViewController</code>.</p>

<p>You have a storyboard.  A storyboard is compiled into a set of nib files, but you don't access those nib files directly.  Instead, you need to give your view controller a Storyboard ID.  Then you can ask the storyboard to instantiate that view controller.</p>

<p>The advantage of the push notification is that it can be presented to the user event if the app is not running.</p>

<p>The drawback is that your application is not told about push notification receiption. Thus, you cannot modify it in the app.</p>

    array = tickets

</code></pre>

<p>(Xcode 6 GM)</p>

<p>Any clue ?</p>
","<p>Don't use <code>Any</code> unless you absolutely have to. Reasoning about it, in exactly this kind of situation, is very tricky. Swift has type-parameterization (generics) for a reason. In most cases you want a struct anyway.</p>

<p>I tried to write out what the type of this thing would actually be, but it's not really possible to write in Swift. The second element is <code>[String:Float]</code>, which is fine. But the first element is <code>[String:[[String: Any]]]</code>, which is a type that Swift will not implicitly promote to (and also happens to be a really insane type). Swift only promotes to <code>Any</code> if you explicitly ask for it exactly where you want it to do so. That's why it doesn't quietly promote to <code>[Any]</code> here. That's a feature. If it were otherwise, all kinds of things would quietly promote to <code>Any</code> and the compiler errors would be even more confusing.</p>

<p>The answer is to avoid <code>Any</code>. What you really have here are a couple of structs:</p>

<pre><code>struct Item {
  let name: String
  let units: Int
}

struct Dico {
  let tickets: [Item]
  let totale: Float
}

let dico = Dico(tickets: [
  Item(name: ""kebab"", units: 1),
  Item(name: ""muffin"", units: 1),
  Item(name: ""coca-cola"", units: 2)
  ],
  totale: 225.00 )

let tickets = dico.tickets
</code></pre>

<p>This is how you should store and deal with your data. If you're starting with something like JSON that returns you a bunch of <code>Any</code> objects, you should parse it into data structures before using it. Otherwise you will fight with this insane dictionary all over the code. I've been writing about JSON parsing in Swift in a series that started with <a href=""http://robnapier.net/functional-wish-fulfillment"" rel=""nofollow"">Functional Wish Fulfillment</a>. I link there to several other similar approaches. The same basic technique applies to any parser, not just JSON.</p>

<p>but i get the compiler errors ""Extra argument 'products' in call"" and ""Expected member name or constructor call after type name"". 
if i try it without the parameters i get ""Missing argument for parameter #1 in call""</p>
","<p>In Swift, your completion handler would be a <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-XID_152"" rel=""nofollow"">closure</a>. The syntax is semi-similar to blocks in Objective-C but, instead of defining the parameters outside the block:</p>

<pre><code>^(BOOL success, NSArray *products) { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>you define them inside the closure:</p>

<pre><code>{ (success: Bool, products: [AnyObject]!) in /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>So, your call to <code>requestProductsWithCompletionHandler</code> should look something like this:</p>

528,24563560,2,0,swift,How do I save JSON array of dictionaries in Swift that maps a String to an Int or String?,"<p>I'm having a lot of difficulty with this one.</p>

<p>My server sends JSON arrays of dictionaries, with the dictionaries having a String as a key, with either a String or an Int as the value for the key. For example, if the key was name, it would return a string, but some values are asking for numeric things like ""time since"" which return Ints.</p>

<p>How do I handle this in Swift?</p>

<p>My first attempt was:</p>

<pre><code>let dictArray = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: .MutableContainers, error: &amp;jsonError) as Dictionary&lt;String, Any&gt;[]
</code></pre>

<p>But I get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fatal error: can't unwrap Optional.none</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I change <code>Any</code> to <code>AnyObject</code> I can't cast it as an <code>Int</code> for some keys, it complains about the subscript.</p>

<p>What should I be doing?</p>
","<p>The Cocoa to Swift binding maps <code>id</code> as <code>AnyObject</code>. And since the keys are not guaranteed to exist in the dictionary, the subscript returns <code>AnyObject?</code>.</p>

<p>Along those lines still seems to be problem with Xcode beta2.
For example, this crashes reproducibly the swift REPL:</p>

<pre><code>let a : AnyObject? = nil
let b : Any? = a
</code></pre>

<p>So that might be the reason as well, why casting to <code>Dictionary&lt;String, Any&gt;[]</code> does not work.</p>

<p>Either way you might be better off using the <em>""literal""</em> mapping <code>Dictionary&lt;String, AnyObject&gt;[]</code> and checking the types yourself.
When casting <code>AnyObject?</code> to <code>Int</code> you have to remember that you are <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24096828/3795188"">actually dealing with an optional</a>. That means you have to unwrap it first using <code>!</code> or an <code>if let</code> construct.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can just iterate over the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonError : NSError?
if var dictArray = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: .MutableContainers, error: &amp;jsonError) as? Dictionary&lt;String, AnyObject&gt;[]
{
    for dict in dictArray
    {
        for (key, data) in dict

            var output : String = ""(unknown)"";
            if let number = data as? Int
            {
                output = ""\(number)""
            }
            else if let str = data as? String
            {
                output = str

1006,25812010,0,0,swift,Apply definitely CGAffineTransform* to a UIView,"<p>I'm having a problem with scale transformation I have to apply to UIViews on Swift (but it's the same in objective-c too)</p>

<p>I'm applying a <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> to multiples views during a <code>gestureRecognizer</code>.</p>

<p>It's like a loop for a cards deck. I remove the one on top and the X others behind scale up and a new one is added in the back.</p>

<p>The first iteration works as expected. But when I try to swipe the new front one, all the cards reset to their initial frame size because i'm trying to apply a new transform, which seems to cancel the previous one and reset the view to its initial state.</p>

<p>How can I apply definitely/commit the first transform change to be able to apply a new one after that based on the UIView resulting new size ?</p>

<p>I tried a <code>UIView.commitAnimations()</code> but no change.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>

<p>Here's a simple example to understand what I try to do :</p>

<p>Imagine I have an initial UIView of 100x100</p>

<p>I have a shrink factor of 0.95, which means next views behind will be 95x95, then 90.25, then 85.73, etc</p>

<p>If I remove the top one (100x100), I want to scale up the others, so the 95x95 will become 100x100, etc<br>
This is done by applying the inverse of the shrink factor, here 1.052631...</p>

<p>First time I apply the inverse factor, all views are correctly resized.<br>
My problem is, when I trigger again by a swipe on the new front UIView a new resize of all views (So, for example, the 90.25x90.25 which became 95x95 should now scale to 100x100).<br>
At this moment, the same <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> is apply to all views, which all instantly reset to their original frame size (so the now 95x95 reset to 90.25x90.25, and then begin to apply the transformation on this old size).</p>

<p>As suggested here or elsewhere, using <code>UIView.commitAnimations()</code> in the end of each transformation don't change anything, and using a <code>CGAffineTransformConcat()</code> is like powering over and over the scaling by himself and of course views become insanely big...</p>

<p>I hope I made myself more clear, that's not easy to explain, don't hesitate to ask if something is wrong here.</p>
","<p>After a lot of reading and consulting colleagues who know better than me about iOS programmation, here's my conclusion :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Applying a <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> only modify visually a view but not its properties, and since it's difficult (and costly) to modify afterward the bounds and/or frame of a view, I should avoid to try to make a transform, update bounds, make another transform, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying the same <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> only reset the effect and not apply to the previous one.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying a <code>CGAffineTransformScale()</code> with the same values on top of the previous <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> (or with a <code>CGAffineTransformConcat()</code>)  has some unpredictable effect and will be very difficult to calculate precisely the new values to apply each time to get the effect I want.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The best way I can go with this is only applying one <code>CGAffineTransformMakeScale()</code> that I will keep updating scales values all along the view's life.
It implies now for me to rework all my implementation logic in reverse, but that's the easiest way to do this right.</p>

","<p>You can't have multiple delegate methods, that's one of the advantages of the block mechanism as opposed to the delegate mechanism.</p>

<p>The <code>sort</code> function is trying to sort the array. It doesn't create a new array, it sorts the one you pass as a parameter. However, since it is a value type, it cannot be a constant and you have to pass it by reference:</p>

<pre><code>var names = [""Mark"", ""Bob"", ""Tracy"", ""John""]
sort(&amp;names, &gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to sort the original array and you want to create a new array instead, use <code>sorted</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>let names = [""Mark"", ""Bob"", ""Tracy"", ""John""]
let sortedNames = sorted(names, &gt;)
</code></pre>

    typealias T : EntityInitializable
    init(initializer: (T) -&gt; ())
}

<p>Any idea about what's wrong? Is it perhaps because I am trying to make recursive use of generics, by creating an instance of a generic and passing a closure with a parameter of the same generic type?</p>
","<p>The reason that your code doesn't work is that there is nothing that says the <code>T</code> in 
EntityInitializable (for clarity I'll call it <code>EntityType</code> from here on) must be equal to the type that implements the protocol. Here's an example that should shed some light on the issue:</p>

<pre><code>class A: EntityInitializable {
    typealias EntityType = B
    init(initializer: (EntityType) -&gt; ()) {

    }
}

class B: EntityInitializable {
    // [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is perfectly fine according to the code you wrote and it's the reason why the compiler doesn't accept the <code>cb</code> closure. Its <code>entity</code> parameter has type <code>T</code>, while <code>EntityInitializable</code> expect its type to be <code>T.EntityType</code>.</p>

<p>The right way to write this code is by using <code>Self</code> which represents the class that implements the protocol:</p>

<pre><code>protocol EntityInitializable {

","<p>Your array still contains <code>NSData</code> when you read it back in (the data you created when archiving it in the first place).

352,24186000,0,0,swift,A scroll view that interacts with a UIPageContol? What is the code for this?,"<p>In <strong>SWIFT</strong>, I have a UIScrollView and a UIPageControl.</p>

<p>I have the code for a first launch of an app, and I have the scroll view added.</p>

<p>I have <code>scrollView.pages = true</code></p>

<p>How do I add programmatic ""objects"" to specific pages, and how do I make the page control interact with the pages to show what page it is on></p>
","<p>You don't exactly add objects to a ""page"", you add them as subview like normal. When you enable paging on a scroll view, it doesn't break up how the objects in its content area are distributed, all it does is make it so that when you release from dragging the scroll view, it will snap to the nearest ""page"" (or interval of page number * width) ((roughly)).</p>

<p>Then as far as making your scroll view interact with page control goes, the basic idea is to implement a UIScrollViewDelegate method, like <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uiscrollviewdelegate_protocol/reference/uiscrollviewdelegate.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIScrollViewDelegate/scrollViewDidEndDecelerating%3a"" rel=""nofollow"">scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:</a>, where you can change the page control's <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uipagecontrol_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIPageControl/currentPage"" rel=""nofollow"">currentPage</a> property to reflect the current page of the scroll view based on its content offset. You'll also want to add an action for the page control's UIControlEventValueChanged control event, in which you can convert the new ""page"" number to a content offset to pass to the scroll view.</p>

I tried to set a boolean to detect when the object pass 2 time in the line the game ends, but it don't work like that so I don't really know how to do this.<br>
Maybe we can detect if the object stands on the line more than 2 seconds ?<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>To simplify the problem I put the line of the top of the screen (self.frame.height), and I spawn the objects under this line, so they never cross the line before the game is over.</p>

<p>The problem now is I have to spawn the objects 40 pixels below the line, or a collision is detected at the spawn point. (It does nothing if I set usesPreciseCollisionDetection = true).</p>

<p>So the 40 pixels collision detection are normal ? </p>

","<p>Why would the item pass the line 2 times? Items always move down. So really, once an item is past the line, you <em>know</em> it will never go above (Well, OK, that's not true -- since you can rotate an item, you could get a long one horizontal and then rotate it to vertical ... do Tetris items come out horizontally?).</p>

<p>So really, your test would be more ""does it never fully cross the line"". E.g. if you know that an item moves at speed X, you could probably just calculate the time it should take to move from top to past the line, then wait that long, then see if it still intersects the top area above the line. If it does, the game is lost.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could set a flag when an item comes to rest on another item. If that flag is set, <em>and</em> the item still intersects the area above the line, the game is lost.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pass the context to each class/ view that needs it.  This seems logical, but it can create a lot of extra code, especially if you need to pass the context to through multiple view that do not need to use it just to get it to the view that does.</p></li>

</ol>
","<p>Most of the time, I just access it through AppDelegate. The CoreData stack is the ONE TIME I use AppDelegate for accessing something, otherwise I avoid it like the plague! If you don't want to do that though, you could use a separate CoreDataStack singleton. Either way, you have everything in one place.</p>

<p>The reason to not recreate the core data stack each time you use it is that each instance of your ManagedObjectContext keeps track of your objects separately. If you create a new one and manipulating objects with it in separate classes, your objects could get out of sync with each other, since each MOC can have it's own internal references to the ManagedObject. Calling <code>-save</code> on the MOC does NOT guarantee that the object is immediately written to the datastore, so if you make changes to an object with two different MOCs in two different classes, you could potentially wind up with object conflicts that you will have to merge.</p>

","<p>You certainly can create a new managed object context on demand. To do so you need to create a new context and set it's parent context or persistent store coordinator. However you'll need to be mindful of when you save changes to those contexts and if it is important for other users of the Core Data stack to be able to see unsaved changes. You may also need to handle merge conflicts if multiple contexts might change the same entities.</p>

<p>This is different than recreating the entire Core Data stack on demand and you need at least a shared persistent store coordinator in order to detect and react to such conflicts rather than just allowing them to be resolved arbitrarily by writes to the persistent store.</p>

<p>My personal preference is to use a dependency injection container to supply contexts to controllers. That gives me one location where I can change the default strategy for creating contexts (create a new child of a common parent each time or share one default context) but also allows me to override that strategy on a case by case basis if I want a particular controller to receive a child context (perhaps so all of it's changes can be discarded or if one case needs a different concurrency type).</p>

","<p>Your code is almost fine just a small fix required. You are not setting up default input method for text field. </p>

<p>First of all probably you don't need <code>IBOutlet</code> on your picker view since you don't want it all the time to be visible in your view and UI builder but instead just pop it up a single time when text box is clicked. So it is safe to remove it. </p>

<p>Secondly you need to change default input to <code>UIPickerView</code> and delegate it to <code>self</code></p>

","<p><code>Any</code> and <code>AnyObject</code> does not conform <code>Equatable</code> so they can not passed.As you have define generic as <code>[T]</code> and it confirms to <code>&lt;T:Equatable&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> repersents specific type so <code>AnyObject</code> and <code>Any</code> is not specific type.</p>

<p>As below code will not show error because <code>T</code> is not conforming to <code>Equatable</code> and it is valid to pass <code>[Any]</code></p>

<pre><code>func finder&lt;T&gt;(array:[T], valueToFind:T) -&gt; Int? {
    for(index, value) in enumerate(array) {

var testArray = [""Dog"", ""Cat"", ""Mouse"", ""Tiger"",2]  //It will refer as Any

finder(testArray, 2)  //not have any errors and it is asuming `testArray` as `Any`
</code></pre>

<p>You can also see further analysis as <code>T</code> require to be specific type</p>

<p>So you need to give specific type for generics which repersent <code>T</code>.As you are passing <code>T</code> <code>valueToFind</code> as <code>String</code> so <code>array</code> also needs to be type  of <code>String</code> as it shows in error of below two statements.If you pass Int than it will show <code>'IntegerLiteralConvertible'</code> error</p>

<pre><code>finder&lt;T:Equatable&gt;(array:[T], valueToFind:T) //Here both `T` should be refer to same type either String or Int

var testArray = [""Dog"", ""Cat"", ""Mouse"", ""Tiger"",2]


finder(testArray, ""Cat"")  //Shows error Cannot convert the expression's type 'Int?' to type 'StringLiteralConvertible'

finder(testArray, 2)  //Shows error Cannot convert the expression's type 'Int?' to type 'IntegerLiteralConvertible'
</code></pre>

<p>or remove the other parameter now it will show <code>Equatable</code> error as it is converting <code>testArray</code> to <code>Any</code> which does not conform <code>Equatable</code> but in this it shows specific error </p>

<pre><code>func finder&lt;T:Equatable&gt;(array:[T]) -&gt; Int? {

    return nil

var testArray = [""Dog"", ""Cat"", ""Mouse"", ""Tiger"",2]

774,25171030,-1,0,swift,How to replace date component separators with other symbols?,"<p>In my app I would like to allow users to select a variety of date formats that suit their preferences for displaying a date. However, I don't want to define a fixed date format, so instead I'm getting the most appropriate format for different components based on the current locale. I understand different locals may use different symbols to separate the components, but I am wondering if it would be possible to set those separator symbols while preserving the correct order of the components as appropriate for that locale.</p>

<p>For example, in the US the following code returns ""09/06/2014"" but in the UK it would be ""06/09/2014"", and I want to preserve that order but replace the slash with dashes or spaces. However I don't believe I can simply parse the returned String and replace instances of '/' with other characters because in some locales they probably don't use '/' (I'm not certain but it seems very likely).</p>

<pre><code>NSDateFormatter.dateFormatFromTemplate(""MMddyyyy"", options: 0, locale: NSLocale.currentLocale())
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to change the date component separator character when at the same time getting the most appropriate format for the current locale?</p>
","<p>I went through all the languages on my iPad and checked out the short date format. I found out that all languages use one of these three delimiters: / . -</p>

<p>So to allow custom delimiters while preserving the format, I just replace those characters with the custom character. For example:</p>

<pre><code>dateFormatter.dateFormat = NSDateFormatter.dateFormatFromTemplate(""MMddyyyy"", options: 0, locale: NSLocale.currentLocale())
cell.dateLabel.text = dateFormatter.stringFromDate(NSDate())
cell.dateLabel.text = cell.dateLabel.text.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString(""/"", withString: "" "", options: nil, range: nil)
cell.dateLabel.text = cell.dateLabel.text.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString(""."", withString: "" "", options: nil, range: nil)
cell.dateLabel.text = cell.dateLabel.text.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString(""-"", withString: "" "", options: nil, range: nil)

And also, after that, will it work with my current code? After commenting out some stuff, and testing, the line that is causing it is <code>imageNumber = Int(arc4random())%13
</code>. How is this fixed?</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    var dotChangingTimer = NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(1, target: self, selector: Selector(""changeDot""), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)

    var theRandomImages: UIImage[] = [dotOne, dotTwo, dotThree, dotFour, dotFive, dotSix, dotSeven, dotEight, dotNine, dotTen, dotEleven, dotTwelve, dotThirteen]

    openingScreenDynamicDot = theRandomImages[Int(imageNumber)]
    let finalChangingDotWelcomePage = UIImageView(image: openingScreenDynamicDot)
    finalChangingDotWelcomePage.frame = CGRectMake(110, 234, 100, 100)

    println(""Unresolved error \(error), \(error!.userInfo)"")
    abort()

<p>Then, you will be able to fetch a date in Core Data with the predicate you want this way:</p>

<pre><code>//Set your datePicker date to 12:00 AM

","<pre><code>&lt;edit&gt;

<p>Your second way of doing things seems to me like a good way to go. Store the integer values for year, month and day, and create a predicate with that. Your usage of NSDateComponents and calendar is great, and so this should be the easiest way to go. Very important: don't use for the time of 00, as midnight is a tricky time (there is daylight savings times in parts of the world, there is the question of whether exactly midnight is part of the previous of the next day). Just enter 12 as the time, to be as far away as you can from midnight. 
Also, i would advice you to watch the WWDC from 2011 'Performing Calendar Calculations, Session 117. It talks among other very interesting things about why midnight is tricky (if not, then that is explained in the 2013 session :) ).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/edit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>NSDate has sub-second accuracy. It's description method (that gets called when you NSLog an NSDate) only displays second-accuracy.
So to use an NSDate in an NSPredicate, always specify 'larger/smaller then or equal to' operators.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate * lastWeek = // ... created using NSCalendar and NSDateComponents.
NSDate * now = [NSDate date];

NSPredicate * entitiesFromAfterLastWeekAndBeforeNow = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""start_date &gt;= %@ AND start_date &lt;= %@"", lastWeek, now];
</code></pre>

<p>I would advice against storing a data in something else the a native NSDate, as you might store dates that are incorrect due to conversions. Also, storing dates as string will make queries a lot slower (as strings have to be parsed, and NSDate is simply a number). But that is another discussion, and you might want to ship, so you have to do what you think is best.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm sorry, only now noticed that you are writing Swift. But I think my example is clear enough that it is convertible to Swift, right?</p>

927,25570720,1,0,swift,Search CoreData for Matching NSDate - Swift,"<p>I want to search through all existing objects to see if there are any matching date objects in CoreData:</p>

<p>Dates are currently saved in my CoreData via the <strong>start_date</strong> attribute with the following format: 2013-08-29 14:27:47 +0000.</p>

<p>I am then letting a user select a date from a UIDatePicker and assigning .date() to variable <strong>date</strong>.</p>

<p>e.g. My Selected <strong>date</strong> = 2013-08-29 17:34:23 +0000.</p>

<p>Below is how i search CoreData, using a predicate. </p>

<pre><code>let predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""start_date contains[search] %@"", date)
let request:NSFetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: ""Project"")
let sortDescriptor:NSSortDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: ""number"", ascending: true)
let sortDescriptorsAry:NSArray = [sortDescriptor]
request.sortDescriptors = sortDescriptorsAry
request.predicate = predicate

return request
</code></pre>

<p>However i get no results. I assume this because both attributes don't match because of the time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>start_date = 2013-08-29 14:27:47 +0000</p>
  
  <p>date       = 2013-08-29 17:34:23 +0000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can i some how tell CoreData to ignore the ""177:34:23 +0000"" bit, or is there a better way?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I do have the option to change the way in which the date format is stored initially:</p>

<p>I have tried this:</p>

<pre><code>    var now:NSDate = self.startDatePicker.date
    var calendar:NSCalendar = NSCalendar(calendarIdentifier: NSGregorianCalendar)
    var components:NSDateComponents = calendar.components(NSCalendarUnit.CalendarUnitYear | NSCalendarUnit.CalendarUnitMonth | NSCalendarUnit.CalendarUnitDay, fromDate: now)
    components.hour = 00
    components.minute = 00
    components.second = 00
    var newDate:NSDate = calendar.dateFromComponents(components)!
</code></pre>

<p>However on some days, my time is being set to a day before.
For Example:</p>

<p>Selecting the 30th August, after transform I get 2014-08-29 23:00:00 +0000</p>
","<p>If you still have to option of changing the way you store data, I would store it on your project-entity as three attributes: an Integer for year, an Integer for month and an Integer for day. It will be easier to code (you can create a predicate like:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger year = ....
NSInteger month = ....
NSInteger day = ....    
[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""day == %@  AND month == %@ and year == %@"", @(day), @(month), @(year)];
</code></pre>

<p>) and this probably work quicker compared to using a string. If you want to go with the string (beware extraneous spaces or other interpunction!), you can in code construct a string with the format 'yyyy-mm-dd' (use NSString stringWithFormat:) and then use an NSPredicate like:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger year = ....
NSInteger month = ....
NSInteger day = ....    
NSString * dateString = [NSStringWithFormat: @""%4i-%2i-%2i"", year, month, day];
[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""dateString contains %@"", dateString];
</code></pre>

<p>However, this will only work if YOU constructed the string that you stored, not the NSDate.description(). If you store actual NSDate, see my first original answer :).</p>

<p>But really, if you still have an option, don't store it as a string. It wil really be problematic, if not now, then later (I can tell from experience).</p>

676,24955060,0,0,swift,Query regarding the internal access control of swift language introduced in XCode 6 beta 4,"<p><strong>-</strong> Being from a <strong>Java</strong> background I was bit confused when i saw the <code>internal</code> access control of newly introduced <strong>Swift</strong> language.</p>

<p><strong>-</strong> In <strong>Java</strong> when <strong>No access specifier</strong> is being added to a field or method then its assumed that the <code>access modifier</code> implemented on that field or method is <code>default</code> which has <code>package level access</code>.</p>

<p><strong>-</strong> As this update on official Swift blog on 23rd July 2014 for XCode 6 beta 4 states <strong>:</strong></p>

<p><code>internal : entities are available to the entire module that includes the definition (e.g. an app or framework target).</code></p>

<p><strong>-</strong> Now in <strong>Java</strong> <code>modules</code> and <code>packages</code> are used interchangeably, so as per the definition of <code>internal</code> in <strong>Swift</strong> language its available to the <code>entire module</code> that includes the definition, for <strong>eg: An app</strong> as stated in the blog.</p>

<p><strong>-</strong> So <code>modules</code> means the <strong>full app</strong> in Swift language ? </p>

<p>If thats the case then <code>public</code> and <code>internal</code> will be serving the same purpose, <strong>but i suppose thats should not the case</strong>. I though that <code>internal</code> is meant for <strong>package/module level access</strong>, but now confused seeing the example provided just after the definition of <code>internal access control</code> on the blog.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mP1K4.png"" alt=""internal definition on the blog""></p>

<p><strong>I will be obliged if anyone can help me clarify this doubt, as I am starting into a new language and I don't want to grasp any wrong interpretation of the features of the language.</strong></p>
","<p>If you create a framework and use internal then that function or property is only available in that framework. When using that framework in an other app (module) then that app will not be able to access that function. It will when you use public.</p>

Itâs basically considered a loose canon.</p>

<p>So what I had to do was explicitly tell the compiler to give me an unretained version, and then the code works great.</p>

295,24139530,0,0,swift,Can't unwrap optional. No UITableViewCell,"<p>I've a table view that has a custom table view cell in it. My problem is that when I try and assign a value to a variable in the custom <code>UITableViewCell</code> I get the stated error. Now, I think its because the said variable is not initialised, but it got me completely stumped.</p>

<p>This is the custom table cell:</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation
import UIKit

class LocationGeographyTableViewCell: UITableViewCell
{
    //@IBOutlet var Map : MKMapView;

    @IBOutlet var AddressLine1 : UILabel;
    @IBOutlet var AddressLine2 : UILabel;
    @IBOutlet var County : UILabel;
    @IBOutlet var Postcode : UILabel;
    @IBOutlet var Telephone : UILabel;

    var location = VisitedLocation();

    func Build(location:VisitedLocation) -&gt; Void
    {
        self.location = location;

        AddressLine1.text = ""test"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My cell for row at index path is:</p>

<pre><code> override func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; UITableViewCell!
    {

        var addressCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""ContactDetail"") as? LocationGeographyTableViewCell;

        }

        addressCell!.Build(Location);

        return addressCell;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As I say I'm completely baffled, the Build function calls the correct function in the <code>UITableViewCell</code>.</p>

<p>Any help will be gratefully appreciated.</p>

<p>Ta</p>
","<p>I just made a simple project with your code, and I have a nil ""AddressLine1"" label, which causes the same error you have. I assume we have the same problem.</p>

<p>I solved it by adding the identifier ""ContactDetail"" to the prototype cell in my storyboard.</p>

<p>I also suggest that you change your code a little :</p>

<pre><code>override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {        
    // This newer API ensures that you always get a cell, so no need for optionals. 
    // Also note the ""let"" that is preferred since you don't plan on changing addressCell
    let addressCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(""ContactDetail"", forIndexPath: indexPath) as LocationGeographyTableViewCell; 

    //addressCell.Build(Location); // the cell is a view, views should not know about model objects

    addressCell.AddressLine1 = Location.addressLine1
    // ... same for all labels, or do all that in a ""configureCell"" function

    return addressCell;

","<p>In IB or your Storyboard, you can use a container view and embed your custom collection view controller inside. This gives you the ability to manipulate each view controller in it's own context, because they each have their own <code>nib</code>, and will handle instantiating your collection view controller auto-magically.</p>

<p>Your <code>PrimaryViewController</code> can look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class PrimaryViewController : UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet private weak _collectionView: UIView
    private var _collectionViewController: CustomCollectionViewController! {
        // ???: You can also iterate through child view controllers looking for a class match if you embed other controllers.
        return self.childViewControllers[0] as CustomCollectionViewController!
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which will also call <code>viewDidLoad()</code> on your <code>CustomCollectionViewController</code>. You can hide and show the view through the <code>_collectionView</code> property, or directly manipulate it through <code>_collectionViewController</code>.</p>

<p>The pain comes from any logic that may be the appearance logic (<code>viewWillAppear(_: Bool)</code>, <code>viewWillDisappear(_: Bool)</code>, etc) because you'll have to trigger those yourself.</p>

","<p>Since CKDatabase init is made unavailable, you will never be able to create an instance of it. So there is no point in creating your MockDatabase because you will never be able to create an instance of that. The only way to do some sort of Mocking is by creating your own DAO class wrapper around the CKDatabase functionality and only call CKDatabase functions using that DAO. Then you could mock that DAO. You could even add extra functionality to that DAO, but then you will not be able to test that. </p>

","<p>Swift's access controls are not bound to inheritance, but rather to files and modules. Those modifiers can be applied to types, type members, global variables and constants.</p>

<p><code>internal</code> is only accessible to files in the same module. This is similar to package private, but it's not visible to subclasses outside the module. Those are used for things that are not part of the public interface but shared amongst the code inside the Framework.</p>

","<p>While this is a poorly worded question, I'm assuming you want to load a SQLite database file from the app bundle into the user's documents directory so you can start with that data and then update it from there.</p>

<p>You're on the correct path, however, rather than copying all 3 files, when you create the default data store file, set your journal_mode to ""DELETE"" using the <code>NSSQLitePragmasOption</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *options = @{NSSQLitePragmasOption: @{@""journal_mode"": @""DELETE""}}
</code></pre>

<p>using this set of options when you add a persistent store to a coordinator when you're creating your default data set will only create a single SQLite file. From there, it'll be easier to copy only a single file over.</p>

<p>I also noticed in your code that you're copying myData.sqlite, but you're trying to load ""acData.sqlite"". Are you trying to load a file that isn't there?</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>
","<p><code>SKScene</code> already has a <code>view</code> property that is its containing <code>SKView</code> so, for that part of your question, just use the already existing property:</p>

<pre><code>class SplashScene: SKScene
{
    override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {
        NSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval(2, target: self, selector: Selector(""transitionToGameScene""), userInfo: nil, repeats: false)

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for your question about pointers: Swift doesn't really have them, at least not pointers to memory locations the ones in c++. You can do what your original code was trying to do, just don't use the <code>&amp;</code> operator; Swift will store a reference to your object instance internally (similar to a c++ pointer, but not something you can mess with directly).</p>

<p>You do have to be careful when it comes to <code>struct</code>s vs <code>class</code>es though. Swift will store references to <code>class</code> instances, but with <code>structs</code> it will actually make a copy of the entire data structure instead of storing a reference to it. See <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_145"" rel=""nofollow"">""Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types""</a>, and <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_146"" rel=""nofollow"">""Classes Are Reference Types""</a> in the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/"" rel=""nofollow"">Swift language reference</a>.</p>

<p>Also the <code>&amp;</code> operator <em>is</em> used from time to time in Swift. It's main use is with <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH10-XID_267"" rel=""nofollow"">In-Out Parameters</a>.

Note: I searched around and <strong>did not</strong> find a repeat question for the Swift language.</p>
","<p>Your question somewhat vague, but I think the word you are looking for is ""protocol"", exhaustively explained in Apple's <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html"" rel=""nofollow"">docs:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following example defines a protocol with a single instance
  method requirement:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -&gt; Double
}
</code></pre>

<p>Somewhere else you create a class that implements the required method:</p>

<pre><code>class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
    var lastRandom = 42.0
    let m = 139968.0
    let a = 3877.0
    let c = 29573.0

    func random() -&gt; Double {
        lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c) % m)
        return lastRandom / m
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And somewhere else you store / use the protocol, calling the method defined on the delegate (that implements the protocol).</p>

<pre><code>class Dice {
    let sides: Int
    let generator: RandomNumberGenerator // delegate object that implements the protocol

    init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator) {
        self.sides = sides
        self.generator = generator
    }

    func roll() -&gt; Int {
        return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As to where you do this, it's the same as Obj-c.  Swift makes it easier as it does not require you to import header files, so you can either put it in the file of the client (the class that uses it), or in it's own file.  Per above, you would declare and implement the protocol method(s) in the class that will become the delegate instance.</p>

","<p>If you need to store a reference to this timer beyond the scope of the one function (which makes sense) then you need to move the declaration of it outside that scope. Likely on some other object that makes sense to hold a reference to that timer. </p>

653,24885880,0,-1,swift,xcode 6 beta 4 new Swift issues with NS_ENUM defined in Objective C,"<p>Just started to use Xcode6 beta 4 and have come up against an issue that was not there before. I define my NS_ENUM in my objective-c as follows:</p>

   tb_text_k = 10,
   tb_shape_k,
   tb_undefined_k

<pre><code>var test = ToolbarType. tb_undefined_k
</code></pre>

<p>This was working without issues in beta 3 but now I get an error that :</p>

<pre><code>'ToolbarType' does not have a member named 'var test = ToolbarType. tb_undefined_k'
</code></pre>

<p>After investigating further, if I type the enum type followed by a ., auto completion shows me the options and it suggests the value to be:</p>

<pre><code>ToolbarType.b_undefined_k
</code></pre>

<p>is seems very odd. Is this a bug or some kind of naming convention? I am afraid if I use these suggested values, in the next release they all become broken.</p>

<p>Any suggestions. Thanks.</p>

<p>Now I want to add a parameter to tuple after which tupleX will have 3 or more parameters</p>

<p>Is it possible?</p>
","<p>The difference between a tuple and a list (or other collections) is precisely the fixed amount of elements it contains.</p>

<p>From a type system perspective <code>(1, 2)</code> and <code>(1, 2, 3)</code> are of two distinct types, so of course you cannot alter the number of elements since you would be changing the type.</p>

<p>It's probably also important to notice that, as explained <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values. They are not suited to the creation of complex data structures. If your data structure is likely to persist beyond a temporary scope, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple.</p>

","<p>I can not locate your specific problem as we need to see the code, and it is strange that Apple did not reject your app.  <strong>BUT</strong> - </p>

<p><strong>Always check your app after archiving it and don't count only on your debug builds.</strong></p>

<p>I had the same issue with app that was rejected by apple on a crash that did not accrue on debug. When I installed the archived version I saw the crash immediately. Apparently there are some changes between the debug version and the archived version. The code is processed differently and new bugs might pop up.</p>

<p>All you need to do is to archive your app with Ad-hoc provisioning and install it on your device to check if it behave the same. (It might not be your problem but you can give it a try).</p>

","<p>The problem is that the if statement is not inside a function. This is OK when the statement is outside the <code>class</code>, but is not in this case. Write a function to run the statement. Add this to your class:</p>

<pre><code>func updateOuts(){
    if counter == 3 {
        outsCounter++
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, inside if statements you should use <code>==</code> instead of <code>=</code>. This is because <code>==</code> compare two values and <code>=</code> sets a variable.</p>

","<p>Like other answers, you can run your app in release mode before submitting for app review.  One specific setting difference between debug mode and release mode by default is the Optimization level setting.  For the debug mode, it is set to none and for the release mode it is set to smallest, fastest.  You can change your debug mode's setting to smallest,fastest.   I recently encountered the same situation.  That was what I did. </p>

","<p>First of all, the review process doesn't change your binary at all. Whatever you submit, is what you get on the store, if approved.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that when you archive your application for the submission, you use the <code>Release</code> configuration, whereas typically you test on your Simulator/device with a <code>Debug</code> configuration.</p>

<p>To test the actual binary on your device before sending it to the store, you have to change the Target schemes such that the Run option uses the <code>Release</code> build configuration.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5lsyC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>There are a few things wrong here. You're trying to assign and Int to something that expects a String. You're also trying to call an instance method of your Computation class without any instance of this class as the receiver. On top of that, you would have to have actually assigned values to the properties on said instance for this to have even worked. I believe this is what you meant to do.</p>

<pre><code>class SecondViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var buttonPressed: UIButton!
    @IBOutlet weak var inputLength: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var inputWidth: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var display: UILabel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }        

    func displayComputation(sender: UIButton) {
        let computationObject = Computation()

        computationObject.inputWidth = inputWidth.text.toInt()!
        computationObject.inputLength = inputLength.text.toInt()!

        display.text = String(format: ""%d"", computationObject.rectanglePerimeter())
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Your instances should have lowerCamelCase, and your classes should have UpperCamelCase.</p>

<p>It also appears that you've made a mistake in the formula if you want to compute area. What you were doing computes perimeter. This is what you want.</p>

<pre><code>class Computation {
    var buttonPressed = 0
    var inputLength = 0
    var inputWidth = 0

    func rectanglePerimeter() -&gt; Int {
        return inputWidth * 2 + inputLength * 2
    }
}

    func rectanglePerimeter() -&gt; Int {
        return 2*inputLength + 2*inputWidth // I think this is what you need    
    }
}

// later
var c = Computation()
var result = c.rectanglePerimeter()
</code></pre>

<p>But you should reconsider of what you are doing here - it is quite a mess (data types and their conversion, class naming and encapsulating, the computation of a rectangle itself, etc.). I think a basic book about object oriented programming would be a good starting point. </p>
