<p>Let's say I have an object <code>o</code>. How do I check whether it's a <code>str</code>?</p>
","<p>The <strong>most</strong> Pythonic way to check the type of an object is... not to check it.</p>

<p>Since Python encourages <a href=""http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"">Duck Typing</a>, you should just try to use the object's methods the way you want to use them.  So if your function is looking for a writable file object, <em>don't</em> check that it's a subclass of <code>file</code>, just try to use its <code>.write()</code> method!</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes these nice abstractions break down and <code>isinstance(obj, cls)</code> is what you need.  But use sparingly.</p>

","<p>I think the cool thing about using a dynamic language like python is you really shouldn't have to check something like that.</p>

<p>I would just call the required methods on your object and catch an <code>AttributeError</code>. Later on this will allow you to call your methods with other (seemingly unrelated) objects to accomplish different tasks, such as mocking an object for testing.</p>

<p>I've used this alot when getting data off the web with <code>urllib2.urlopen()</code> which returns a <em>file like</em> object. This can in turn can be passed to almost any method that reads from a file, because is implements the same <code>read()</code> method as a real file.</p>

<p>For displaying, comparisons and storage you can leave it in string format across all languages. If you need the date for calculations easy to convert it back to a native date object in most language.</p>

","<p>There is <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"">PEP 8</a>, as other answers show, but PEP 8 is only the styleguide for the standard library, and it's only taken as gospel therein. One of the most frequent deviations of PEP 8 for other pieces of code is the variable naming, specifically for methods. There is no single predominate style, although considering the volume of code that uses mixedCase, if one were to make a strict census one would probably end up with a version of PEP 8 with mixedCase. There is little other deviation from PEP 8 that is quite as common.</p>

","<p>Most python people prefer underscores, but even I am using python since more than 5 years right now, I still do not like them. They just look ugly to me, but maybe that's all the Java in my head. </p>

<p>I simply like CamelCase better since it fits better with the way classes are named, It feels more logical to have <code>SomeClass.doSomething()</code> than <code>SomeClass.do_something()</code>. If you look around in the global module index in python, you will find both, which is due to the fact that it's a collection of libraries from various sources that grew overtime and not something that was developed by one company like Sun with strict coding rules. I would say the bottom line is: Use whatever you like better, it's just a question of personal taste.</p>

","<p>Quoting <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/lists/python-list/531365/"">Jacob Hallen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proper use of <code>__slots__</code> is to save space in objects. Instead of having
  a dynamic dict that allows adding attributes to objects at anytime,
  there is a static structure which does not allow additions after creation.
  This saves the overhead of one dict for every object that uses slots. While this is sometimes a useful optimization, it would be completely
  unnecessary if the Python interpreter was dynamic enough so that it would
  only require the dict when there actually were additions to the object.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately there is a side effect to slots. They change the behavior of
  the objects that have slots in a way that can be abused by control freaks
  and static typing weenies. This is bad, because the control freaks should
  be abusing the metaclasses and the static typing weenies should be abusing
  decorators, since in Python, there should be only one obvious way of doing something.</p>
  
  <p>Making CPython smart enough to handle saving space without <code>__slots__</code> is a major
  undertaking, which is probably why it is not on the list of changes for P3k (yet).</p>

","<p>You have â essentially â no use for <code>__slots__</code>.  </p>

<p>For the time when you think you might need <code>__slots__</code>, you actually want to use <strong>Lightweight</strong> or <strong>Flyweight</strong> design patterns. These are cases when you no longer want to use purely Python objects. Instead, you want a Python object-like wrapper around an array, struct, or numpy array.</p>

<pre><code>class Flyweight(object):

","<p>Each python object has a <code>__dict__</code> atttribute which is a dictionary containing all other attributes. e.g. when you type <code>self.attr</code> python is actually doing <code>self.__dict__['attr']</code>. As you can imagine using a dictionary to store attribute takes some extra space &amp; time for accessing it.</p>

<p>However, when you use <code>__slots__</code>, any object created for that class won't have a <code>__dict__</code> attribute. Instead, all attribute access is done directly via pointers.</p>

<p>So if want a C style structure rather than a full fledged class you can use <code>__slots__</code> for compacting size of the objects &amp; reducing attribute access time. A good example is a Point class containing attributes x &amp; y. If you are going to have a lot of points, you can try using <code>__slots__</code> in order to conserve some memory.</p>

","<p>From an efficiency perspective, you're not going to beat translate() - it's performing raw string operations in C with a lookup table - there's not much that will beat that but writing your own C code.
If speed isn't a worry, another option though is:</p>

<pre><code>exclude = set(string.punctuation)
s = ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)
</code></pre>

<p>This is faster than s.replace with each char, but won't perform as well as non-pure python approaches such as regexes or string.translate, as you can see from the below timings.  For this type of problem, doing it at as low a level as possible pays off.</p>

<p>Timing code:</p>

<pre><code>import re, string, timeit

s = ""string. With. Punctuation""
exclude = set(string.punctuation)
table = string.maketrans("""","""")
regex = re.compile('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation))

def test_set(s):
    return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)

def test_re(s):  # From Vinko's solution, with fix.
    return regex.sub('', s)

def test_trans(s):
    return s.translate(table, string.punctuation)

def test_repl(s):  # From S.Lott's solution
    for c in string.punctuation:
        s=s.replace(c,"""")
    return s

print ""sets      :"",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_set as f').timeit(1000000)
print ""regex     :"",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_re as f').timeit(1000000)
print ""translate :"",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_trans as f').timeit(1000000)
print ""replace   :"",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_repl as f').timeit(1000000)
</code></pre>

<p>Related question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135664/how-many-bytes-per-element-are-there-in-a-python-list-tuple"">How many bytes per element are there in a Python list (tuple)?</a></p>

<p>I am using an XML file which contains size fields that specify the size of value. I must parse this XML and do my coding. When I want to change the value of a particular field, I will check the size field of that value. Here I want to compare whether the new value that I'm gong to enter is of the same size as in XML. I need to check the size of new value. In case of a string I can say its the length. But in case of int, float, etc. I am confused.</p>
","<p>Just use the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.getsizeof"">sys.getsizeof</a> function defined in the <code>sys</code> module.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>sys.getsizeof(object[, default])</code>:</p>
  
  <p>Return the size of an object in bytes.
  The object can be any type of object.
  All built-in objects will return
  correct results, but this does not
  have to hold true for third-party
  extensions as it is implementation
  specific.</p>
  
  <p>The <code>default</code> argument allows to define
  a value which will be returned if the
  object type does not provide means to
  retrieve the size and would cause a
  <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
  
  <p><code>getsizeof</code> calls the objectâs
  <code>__sizeof__</code> method and adds an additional garbage collector overhead
  if the object is managed by the
  garbage collector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usage example, in python 3.0:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(x)
14
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(sys.getsizeof)
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof('this')
38
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof('this also')
48

<p>If you are in python &lt; 2.6 and don't have <code>sys.getsizeof</code> you can use <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/546530/"">this extensive module</a> instead. Never used it though.</p>

","<p><strong>Starting with Python 2.6</strong> (and if you're on Python 3) you have a <strong>standard-library</strong> tool for this: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations""><code>itertools.permutations</code></a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you're using an <strong>older Python (&lt;2.6)</strong> for some reason or are just curious to know how it works, here's one nice approach, taken from  <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/252178/"">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/252178/</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def all_perms(elements):
    if len(elements) &lt;=1:
        yield elements
    else:
        for perm in all_perms(elements[1:]):

                # nb elements[0:1] works in both string and list contexts
                yield perm[:i] + elements[0:1] + perm[i:]
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of alternative approaches are listed in the documentation of <code>itertools.permutations</code>. Here's one:</p>

<pre><code>def permutations(iterable, r=None):
    # permutations('ABCD', 2) --&gt; AB AC AD BA BC BD CA CB CD DA DB DC
    # permutations(range(3)) --&gt; 012 021 102 120 201 210
    pool = tuple(iterable)
    n = len(pool)
    r = n if r is None else r
    if r &gt; n:
        return
    indices = range(n)
    cycles = range(n, n-r, -1)
    yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices[:r])
    while n:
        for i in reversed(range(r)):
            cycles[i] -= 1
            if cycles[i] == 0:
                indices[i:] = indices[i+1:] + indices[i:i+1]
                cycles[i] = n - i
            else:
                j = cycles[i]
                indices[i], indices[-j] = indices[-j], indices[i]
                yield tuple(pool[i] for i in indices[:r])
                break
        else:
            return
</code></pre>

<p>And another, based on <code>itertools.product</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def permutations(iterable, r=None):
    pool = tuple(iterable)
    n = len(pool)
    r = n if r is None else r
    for indices in product(range(n), repeat=r):

","<p>This can be more complicated than it looks depending on how you want to count things.  For instance, if you have a list of ints, do you want the size of the list containing the <em>references</em> to the ints? (ie. list only, not what is contained in it), or do you want to include the actual data pointed to, in which case you need to deal with duplicate references, and how to prevent double-counting when two objects contain references to the same object. </p>

<p>You may want to take a look at one of the python memory profilers, such as <a href=""http://pysizer.8325.org/"">pysizer</a> to see if they meet your needs.</p>

<p>Discussion:<br />
In Python, you cannot ever access ""direct"" memory addresses.  Why, then, would you need or want to know how many such addresses are occupied by a given object??  It's a question that's entirely inappropriate at that level of abstraction.  When you're painting your house, you don't ask what frequencies of light are absorbed or reflected by each of the constituent atoms within the paint, you just ask what color it is -- the details of the physical characteristics that create that color are beside the point.  Similarly, the number of bytes of memory that a given Python object occupies is beside the point.</p>

<p>So, why are you trying to use Python to write C code? :)</p>

<pre><code>/* File : example.c */
int fact(int n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
    else return n*fact(n-1);

<pre><code>swig -python example.i
gcc -fPIC -c example.c example_wrap.c -I/usr/local/include/python2.7
gcc -shared example.o example_wrap.o -o _example.so
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import example
&gt;&gt;&gt; example.fact(5)

<p>Note that you have to have python-dev. Also in some systems python header files will be in /usr/include/python2.7 based on the way you have installed it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SWIG is a fairly complete C++ compiler with support for nearly every language feature. This includes preprocessing, pointers, classes, inheritance, and even C++ templates. SWIG can also be used to package structures and classes into proxy classes in the target language â exposing the underlying functionality in a very natural manner.</p>

","<p>You don't need to use 4 spaces on your second conditional line.  Maybe use:</p>

       cond3 == 'val3' and cond4 == 'val4'):
    do_something

<p>Also, don't forget the whitespace is more flexible than you might think:</p>

<pre><code>if (

<p>Both of those are fairly ugly though.</p>

<p>Maybe lose the brackets (the <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#multiline-if-statements"">Style Guide</a> discourages this though)?</p>

<p>But this isn't very pretty. :-)</p>

<p>Can you recommend an alternative way ?</p>
","<p>Just a few other random ideas for completeness's sake.  If they work for you, use them.  Otherwise, you're probably better off trying something else.</p>

<p>You could also do this with a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = {'cond1' : 'val1', 'cond2' : 'val2'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = {'cond1' : 'val1', 'cond2' : 'val2'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; x == y
True
</code></pre>

<p>This option is more complicated, but you may also find it useful:</p>

<pre><code>class Klass(object):
    def __init__(self, some_vars):
        #initialize conditions here
    def __nonzero__(self):
        return (self.cond1 == 'val1' and self.cond2 == 'val2' and
                self.cond3 == 'val3' and self.cond4 == 'val4')

foo = Klass()
if foo:
    print ""foo is true!""
else:
    print ""foo is false!""
</code></pre>

<p>Dunno if that works for you, but it's another option to consider.  Here's one more way:</p>

<pre><code>class Klass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        #initialize conditions here
    def __eq__(self):
        return (self.cond1 == 'val1' and self.cond2 == 'val2' and
               self.cond3 == 'val3' and self.cond4 == 'val4')

x = Klass(some_values)
y = Klass(some_other_values)
if x == y:
    print 'x == y'
else:
    print 'x!=y'
</code></pre>

<p>The last two I haven't tested, but the concepts should be enough to get you going if that's what you want to go with.</p>

<p>(And for the record, if this is just a one time thing, you're probably just better off using the method you presented at first.  If you're doing the comparison in lots of places, these methods may enhance readability enough to make you not feel so bad about the fact that they are kind of hacky.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
  C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes
  functions and objects to Python, and vice-versa, using no special
  tools -- just your C++ compiler. It is designed to wrap C++ interfaces
  non-intrusively, so that you should not have to change the C++ code at
  all in order to wrap it, making Boost.Python ideal for exposing
  3rd-party libraries to Python. The library's use of advanced
  metaprogramming techniques simplifies its syntax for users, so that
  wrapping code takes on the look of a kind of declarative interface
  definition language (IDL).</p>

","<p>I like <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html"">ctypes</a> a lot, <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"">swig</a> always tended to give me <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/d94badd9847fe43a?pli=1"">problems</a>. Also ctypes has the advantage that you don't need to satisfy any compile time dependency on python, and your binding will work on any python that has ctypes, not just the one it was compiled against.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a simple C++ example class you want to talk to in a file called foo.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Foo{
    public:
        void bar(){
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Since ctypes can only talk to C functions, you need to provide those declaring them as extern ""C""</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" {
    Foo* Foo_new(){ return new Foo(); }
    void Foo_bar(Foo* foo){ foo-&gt;bar(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next you have to compile this to a shared library</p>

<pre><code>g++ -c -fPIC foo.cpp -o foo.o
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so -o libfoo.so  foo.o
</code></pre>

<p>And finally you have to write your python wrapper (e.g. in fooWrapper.py)</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import cdll
lib = cdll.LoadLibrary('./libfoo.so')

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.obj = lib.Foo_new()

    def bar(self):
        lib.Foo_bar(self.obj)
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have that you can call it like</p>

<pre><code>f = Foo()
f.bar() #and you will see ""Hello"" on the screen

764,390250,1,222,python,"Elegant ways to support equivalence (""equality"") in Python classes","<p>When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True
</code></pre>
","<p>The 'is' test will test for identity using the builtin 'id()' function which essentially returns the memory address of the object and therefore isn't overloadable.</p>

<p>However in the case of testing the equality of a class you probably want to be a little bit more strict about your tests and only compare the data attributes in your class:</p>

<pre><code>import types

class ComparesNicely(object):

    def __eq__(self, other):
        for key, value in self.__dict__.iteritems():
            if (isinstance(value, types.FunctionType) or 
                    key.startswith(""__"")):
                continue

            if key not in other.__dict__:
                return False

            if other.__dict__[key] != value:
                return False

         return True
</code></pre>

<p>This code will only compare non function data members of your class as well as skipping anything private which is generally what you want. In the case of Plain Old Python Objects I have a base class which implements __init__, __str__, __repr__ and __eq__ so my POPO objects don't carry the burden of all that extra (and in most cases identical) logic.</p>

In python you always hold a reference to an object in a variable not the actual object, so essentially for a is b to be true the objects in them should be located in the same memory location. How and most importantly why would you go about overriding this behaviour?</p>

761,390250,2,222,python,"Elegant ways to support equivalence (""equality"") in Python classes","<p>When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True
</code></pre>
","<p>I think that the two terms you're looking for are <strong>equality</strong> (==) and <strong>identity</strong> (is). For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True       &lt;-- a and b have values which are equal
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False      &lt;-- a and b are not the same list object

414,209470,16,207,python,Can I use Python as a Bash replacement?,"<p>I currently do my textfile manipulation through a bunch of badly remembered AWK, sed, Bash and a tiny bit of Perl.</p>

<p>I've seen mentioned a few places that python is good for this kind of thing, I know a little and I would like to know more. Is Python a good choice for this, and is there a good book or guide to learning how to use Python to replace shell scripting, AWK, sed and friends?</p>
","<p>In the beginning there was sh, sed, and awk (and find, and grep, and...). It was good. But awk can be an odd little beast and hard to remember if you don't use it often. Then the great camel created Perl. Perl was a system administrator's dream. It was like shell scripting on steroids. Text processing, including regular expressions were just part of the language. Then it got ugly...  People tried to make big applications with Perl. Now, don't get me wrong, Perl can be an application, but it can (can!) look like a mess if you're not really careful. Then there is all this flat data business. It's enough to drive a programmer nuts.</p>

<p>Enter Python, Ruby, et al. These are really very good general purpose languages. They support text processing, and do it well (though perhaps not as tightly entwined in the basic core of the language). But they also scale up very well, and still have nice looking code at the end of the day. They also have developed pretty hefty communities with plenty of libraries for most anything.</p>

<p>Now, much of the negativeness towards Perl is a matter of opinion, and certainly some people can write very clean Perl, but with this many people complaining about it being too easy to create obfuscated code, you know some grain of truth is there. The question really becomes then, are you ever going to use this language for more than simple bash script replacements. If not, learn some more Perl.. it is absolutely fantastic for that.

","<p>Any shell has several sets of features.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Essential Linux/Unix commands.  All of these are available through the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html"">subprocess</a> library.  This isn't always the best first choice for doing <em>all</em> external commands.  Look also at <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html"">shutil</a> for some commands that are separate Linux commands, but you could probably implement directly in your Python scripts.  Another huge batch of Linux commands are in the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html"">os</a> library; you can do these more simply in Python.</p>

<p>And -- bonus! -- more quickly.  Each separate Linux command in the shell (with a few exceptions) forks a subprocess.  By using Python <code>shutil</code> and <code>os</code> modules, you don't fork a subprocess.</p></li>
<li><p>The shell environment features.  This includes stuff that sets a command's environment (current directory and environment variables and what-not).  You can easily manage this from Python directly.</p></li>
<li><p>The shell programming features.  This is all the process status code checking, the various logic commands (if, while, for, etc.) the test command and all of it's relatives.  The function definition stuff.  This is all much, much easier in Python.  This is one of the huge victories in getting rid of bash and doing it in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction features.  This includes command history and what-not.  You don't need this for writing shell scripts.  This is only for human interaction, and not for script-writing.</p></li>
<li><p>The shell file management features.  This includes redirection and pipelines.  This is trickier.  Much of this can be done with subprocess.  But some things that are easy in the shell are unpleasant in Python.  Specifically stuff like <code>(a | b; c ) | something &gt;result</code>.  This runs two processes in parallel (with output of <code>a</code> as input to <code>b</code>), followed by a third process.  The output from that sequence is run in parallel with <code>something</code> and the output is collected into a file named <code>result</code>.  That's just complex to express in any other language.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Specific programs (awk, sed, grep, etc.) can often be rewritten as Python modules.  Don't go overboard.  Replace what you need and evolve your ""grep"" module.  Don't start out writing a Python module that replaces ""grep"".</p>

<p>The best thing is that you can do this in steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Replace AWK and PERL with Python.  Leave everything else alone.</li>
<li>Look at replacing GREP with Python.  This can be a bit more complex, but your version of GREP can be tailored to your processing needs.</li>
<li>Look at replacing FIND with Python loops that use <code>os.walk</code>.  This is a big win because you don't spawn as many processes.</li>
<li>Look at replacing common shell logic (loops, decisions, etc.) with Python scripts.</li>
</ol>

","<p>If your textfile manipulation usually is one-time, possibly done on the shell-prompt, you will not get anything better from python.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you usually have to do the same (or similar) task over and over, and you have to write your scripts for doing that, then python is great - and you can easily create your own libraries (you can do that with shell scripts too, but it's more cumbersome).</p>

stdout_text, stdin_text=popen2.popen2(""your-shell-command-here"")

  if line.startswith(""#""):
    pass
  else
    jobID=int(line.split("","")[0].split()[1].lstrip(""&lt;"").rstrip(""&gt;""))
    # do something with jobID

","<p>Your best bet is a tool that is specifically geared towards your problem.  If it's processing text files, then Sed, Awk and Perl are the top contenders.  Python is a general-purpose <em>dynamic</em> language.  As with any general purpose language, there's support for file-manipulation, but that isn't what it's core purpose is.  I would consider Python or Ruby if I had a requirement for a dynamic language in particular.</p>

<p>In short, learn Sed and Awk really well, plus all the other goodies that come with your flavour of *nix (All the Bash built-ins, grep, tr and so forth).  If it's text file processing you're interested in, you're already using the right stuff. </p>

","<p>As others here have stated, you can just use full datetime objects throughout:</p>

<pre><code>sometime = get_some_time() # the time to which you want to add 3 seconds
later = (datetime.combine(date.today(), sometime) + timedelta(seconds=3)).time()
</code></pre>

<p>However, I think it's worth explaining why full datetime objects are required.  Consider what would happen if I added 2 hours to 11pm.  What's the correct behavior?  An exception, because you can't have a time larger than 11:59pm?  Should it wrap back around?</p>

<p>Different programmers will expect different things, so whichever result they picked would surprise a lot of people.  Worse yet, programmers would write code that worked just fine when they tested it initially, and then have it break later by doing something unexpected.  This is very bad, which is why you're not allowed to add timedelta objects to time objects.</p>

712,366980,417,184,python,"What are the differences between Perl, Python, AWK and sed?","<p>just want to know what are the main differences among them? and the power of each language (where it's better to use it).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> it's not ""vs."" like topic, just information.</p>
","<p>In order of appearance, the languages are <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>perl</code>, <code>python</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>sed</code> program is a stream editor, and is designed to apply the actions from a script to each line (or, more generally, to specified ranges of lines) of the input file or files.  Its language is based on <code>ed</code>, the Unix editor, and although it has conditionals and so on, it is hard to work with for complex tasks.  You can work minor miracles with it - but at a cost to the hair on your head.  However, it is probably the fastest of the programs when attempting tasks within its remit.  (It has the least powerful regular expressions of the programs discussed - adequate for many purposes, but certainly not PCRE - Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions)</p>

<p>The <code>awk</code> program (name from the initials of its authors - Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan) is a tool originally for formatting reports.  It can be used as a souped up <code>sed</code>; in its more recent versions, it is computationally complete.  It uses an interesting idea - the program is based on 'patterns matched' and 'actions taken when the pattern matches'.  The patterns are fairly powerful (Extended Regular Expressions).  The language for the actions is similar to C.  One of the key features of <code>awk</code> is that it splits the input lines into fields automatically.</p>

<p>Perl was written in part as an awk-killer and sed-killer.  Two of the programs provided with it are <code>a2p</code> and <code>s2p</code> for converting <code>awk</code> scripts and <code>sed</code> scripts into Perl.  Perl is one of the earliest of the next generation of scripting languages (Tcl/Tk can probably claim primacy).  It has powerful integrated regular expression handling with a vastly more powerful language.  It provides access to almost all system calls, and has the extensibility of the CPAN modules.  (Neither <code>awk</code> nor <code>sed</code> is extensible.)  One of Perl's mottos is ""TMTOWTDI - There's more than one way to do it"" (pronounced ""tim-toady"").  Perl has 'objects', but it is more of an add-on than a fundamental part of the language.</p>

<p>Python was written last, and probably in part as a reaction to Perl.  It has some interesting syntactic ideas (indenting to indicate levels - no braces or equivalents).  It is more fundamentally object-oriented than Perl; it is just as extensible as Perl.</p>

<p>OK - when to use each?</p>

<ul>
<li>sed - when you need to do simple text transforms on files.</li>
<li>awk - when you only need simple formatting and summarization or transformation of data.</li>
<li>perl - for almost any task, but especially when the task needs complex regular expressions.</li>
<li>python - for the same tasks that you could use Perl for.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not aware of anything that Perl can do that Python can't, nor vice versa.  The choice between the two would depend on other factors.  I learned Perl before there was a Python, so I tend to use it.  Python has less accreted syntax and is generally somewhat simpler to learn.  Perl 6, when it becomes available, will be a fascinating development.</p>

","<p>I wouldn't call sed a fully-fledged programming language, it is a stream editor with language constructs aimed at editing text files programmatically.</p>

<p>Awk is a little more of a general purpose language but it is still best suited for text processing.</p>

<p>Perl and Python are fully fledged, general purpose programming languages.  Perl has its roots in text processing and has a number of awk-like constructs (there is even an awk-to-perl script floating around on the net).  There are many differences between Perl and Python, your best bet is probably to read the summaries of both languages on something like Wikipedia to get a good grasp on what they are.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> it's not ""vs."" like topic, just information.</p>
","<p>First, there are two unrelated things in the list ""Perl, Python awk and sed"".</p>

<p>Thing 1 - simplistic text manipulation tools.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>sed.  It has a fixed, relatively simple scope of work defined by the idea of reading and examining each line of a file.  sed is not designed to be particularly readable.  It is designed to be very small and very efficient on very tiny unix servers.</p></li>
<li><p>awk.  It has a slightly less fixed, less simple scope of work.  However, the main loop of an awk program is defined by the implicit reading of lines of a source file. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are not ""complete"" programming languages.  While you can -- with some work -- write fairly sophisticated programs in awk, it rapidly gets complicated and difficult to read.</p>

<p>Thing 2 - general-purposes programming languages.  These have a rich variety of statement types, numerous built-in data structures, and no wired-in assumptions or shortcuts to speak of.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Perl.</p></li>
<li><p>Python. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>When to use them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>sed.  Never.  It really doesn't have any value in the modern era of computers with more than 32K of memory.  Perl or Python do the same things more clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>awk.  Never.  Like sed, it reflects an earlier era of computing.  Rather than maintain this language (in addition to all the other required for a successful system), it's more pleasant to simply do everything in one pleasant language.</p></li>
<li><p>Perl.  Any programming problem of any kind.  If you like free-thinking syntax, where there are many, many ways to do the same thing, perl is fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Python.   Any programming problem of any kind.  If you like fairly limited syntax, where there are fewer choices, less subtlety, and (perhaps) more clarity.  Python's object-oriented nature makes it more suitable for large, complex problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Background -- I'm not bashing sed and awk out of ignorance.  I learned awk over 20 years ago.  Did many things with it; used to teach it as a core unix skill.  I learned Perl about 15 years ago.  Did many sophisticated things with it.  I've left both behind because I can do the same things in Python -- and it is simpler and more clear.</p>

<p>There are two serious problems with sed and awk, neither of which are their age.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The incompleteness of their implementation. Everything sed and awk do can be done in Python or Perl, often more simply and sometimes faster, too.  A shell pipeline has some performance advantages because of its multi-processing.   Python offers a <code>subprocess</code> module to allow me to recover those advantages.</p></li>
<li><p>The need to learn yet another language.  By doing things in Python (or Perl) your implementation depends on fewer languages, with a resulting increase in clarity.</p></li>

","<p>Here are my first impressions of pyflakes, pychecker and pylint:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>pychecker</strong>: It crashes frequently, most of the runs I tried resulted in Errors that originated in the pychecker code (eg: AttributeError or IndexError: list index out of range were the most common).  For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pyflakes</strong>: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
      eventlist/views.py:59: 'authenticate' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:61: redefinition of unused 'login' from
  line 59<br>
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used;
  unable to detect undefined names <br>
     eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>pylint</strong>: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).  This means that a fair number of otherwise valuable errors are generated about missing class fields.  eg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E:105:get_events_by_tag: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parsing these out automatically will be very difficult without some additional knowledge of the classes in use.  I'm not sure adding that is feasible, but it does seem likely that pylint is capable of dealing with this in the ""right"" way.  (I probably just need to point it to the django source, but there are no command line params that look likely, and, as mentioned earlier, the user manual is inaccessible.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the moment, I'm still looking into pylint -- pychecker and pyflakes need better documentation and they need to become more robust.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://www.logilab.org/857"">pylint</a> is the best such tool I've found.

<p><em>Edit: this is actually a bug in python -> supposedly it is fixed in the 3.0 branch (and perhaps also in 2.6)</em></p>
","<p>For the <strong>complete</strong> list of attributes, the short answer is: no. The problem is that the attributes are actually defined as the arguments accepted by the <code>getattr</code> built-in function. As the user can reimplement <code>__getattr__</code>, suddenly allowing any kind of attribute, there is no possible generic way to generate that list. The <code>dir</code> function returns the keys in the <code>__dict__</code> attribute, i.e. all the attributes accessible if the <code>__getattr__</code> method is not reimplemented.</p>

<p>For the second question, it does not really make sense. Actually, methods are callable attributes, nothing more. You could though filter callable attributes, and, using the <code>inspect</code> module determine the class methods, methods or functions.</p>

<p>How are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface"">WSGI</a>, CGI, and the frameworks all connected?

How to install WSGI support?</p>
","<p><strong>How WSGI, CGI, and the frameworks are all connected ?</strong></p>

<p>Apache listens on port 80.  It gets an HTTP request.  It parses the request to find a way to respond.  Apache has a LOT of choices for responding.   One way to respond is to use CGI to run a script.  Another way to respond is to simply serve a file.  </p>

<p>In the case of CGI, Apache prepares an environment and invokes the script through the CGI protocol.  This is a standard Unix Fork/Exec situation -- the CGI subprocess inherits an OS environment including the socket and stdout.  The CGI subprocess writes a response, which goes back to Apache; Apache sends this response to the browser.</p>

<p>CGI is primitive and annoying.  Mostly because it forks a subprocess for every request, and subprocess must exit or close stdout and stderr to signify end of response.</p>

<p>WSGI is an interface that is based on the CGI design pattern.  It is not necessarily CGI -- it does not have to fork a subprocess for each request.  It can be CGI, but it doesn't have to be.</p>

<p>WSGI adds to the CGI design pattern in several important ways.  It parses the HTTP Request Headers for you and adds these to the environment.  It supplies any POST-oriented input as a file-like object in the environment.  It also provides you a function that will formulate the response, saving you from a lot of formatting details.</p>

<p><strong>What do I need to know / install / do if I want to run a web framework (say web.py or cherrypy) on my basic CGI configuration ?</strong></p>

<p>Recall that forking a subprocess is expensive.  There are two ways to work around this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Embedded</strong> <code>mod_wsgi</code> or <code>mod_python</code> embeds Python inside Apache; no process is forked.  Apache runs the Django application directly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daemon</strong> <code>mod_wsgi</code> or <code>mod_fastcgi</code> allows Apache to interact with a separate daemon (or ""long-running process""), using the WSGI protocol.  You start your long-running Django process, then you configure Apache's mod_fastcgi to communicate with this process.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <code>mod_wsgi</code> can work in either mode: embedded or daemon.</p>

<p>When you read up on mod_fastcgi, you'll see that Django uses <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup/"">flup</a> to create a WSGI-compatible interface from the information provided by mod_fastcgi.  The pipeline works like this.</p>

<pre><code>Apache -&gt; mod_fastcgi -&gt; FLUP (via FastCGI protocol) -&gt; Django (via WSGI protocol)
</code></pre>

<p>Django has several ""django.core.handlers"" for the various interfaces.</p>

<p>For mod_fastcgi, Django provides a <code>manage.py runfcgi</code> that integrates FLUP and the handler.</p>

<p>For mod_wsgi, there's a core handler for this.</p>

However every time there is a request a new Python interpreter is started and the whole context (database connections, etc.) needs to be build which all take time.</p>

<p>The best if you want to run WSGI would be if your host would install <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/"">mod_wsgi</a> and made an appropriate configuration to defer control to an application of yours.</p>

<p><a href=""http://trac.saddi.com/flup"">Flup</a> is another way to run with WSGI for any webserver that can speak <a href=""http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/"">FCGI</a>, <a href=""http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/"">SCGI</a> or AJP.

","<p>It's a simple abstraction layer for Python, akin to what the Servlet spec is for Java.  Whereas CGI is really low level and just dumps stuff into the process environment and standard in/out, the above two specs model the http request and response as constructs in the language.  My impression however is that in Python folks have not quite settled on de-facto implementations so you have a mix of reference implementations, and other utility-type libraries that provide other things along with WSGI support (e.g. Paste).  Of course I could be wrong, I'm a newcomer to Python.  The ""web scripting"" community is coming at the problem from a different direction (shared hosting, CGI legacy, privilege separation concerns) than Java folks had the luxury of starting with (running a single enterprise container in a dedicated environment against statically compiled and deployed code).</p>

","<p>I think <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/219110/how-python-web-frameworks-wsgi-and-cgi-fit-together/219124#219124"">Florian's answer</a> answers the part of your question about ""what is WSGI"", especially if you read <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333"">the PEP</a>.</p>

<p>As for the questions you pose towards the end:</p>

<p>WSGI, CGI, FastCGI etc. are all protocols for a web server to <em>run code</em>, and deliver the dynamic content that is produced. Compare this to static web serving, where a plain HTML file is basically delivered as is to the client.</p>

<p><strong>CGI, FastCGI and SCGI are language agnostic.</strong> You can write CGI scripts in Perl, Python, C, bash, whatever. CGI defines <em>which</em> executable will be called, based on the URL, and <em>how</em> it will be called: the arguments and environment. It also defines how the return value should be passed back to the web server once your executable is finished. The variations are basically optimisations to be able to handle more requests, reduce latency and so on; the basic concept is the same.</p>

<p><strong>WSGI is Python only.</strong> Rather than a language agnostic protocol, a standard function signature is defined:</p>

<pre><code>def simple_app(environ, start_response):
    """"""Simplest possible application object""""""
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type','text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return ['Hello world!\n']
</code></pre>

<p>That is a complete (if limited) WSGI application. A web server with WSGI support (such as Apache with mod_wsgi) can invoke this function whenever a request arrives.</p>

<p>The reason this is so great is that we can avoid the messy step of converting from a HTTP GET/POST to CGI to Python, and back again on the way out. It's a much more direct, clean and efficient linkage.</p>

<p>It also makes it much easier to have long-running frameworks running behind web servers, if all that needs to be done for a request is a function call. With plain CGI, you'd have to <a href=""http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/RunAsCGI"">start your whole framework up</a> for each individual request.</p>

<p>To have WSGI support, you'll need to have installed a WSGI module (like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/"">mod_wsgi</a>), or use a web server with WSGI baked in (like <a href=""http://tools.cherrypy.org/"">CherryPy</a>). If neither of those are possible, you <em>could</em> use the CGI-WSGI bridge given in the PEP.</p>

","<p>Not directly an answer to your question, but you should consider naming it <code>__version__</code>, not <code>version</code>.</p>

<p>This is almost a quasi-standard. Many modules in the standard library use <code>__version__</code>, and this is also used in <a href=""http://www.google.com/codesearch?as_q=__version__&amp;btnG=Search+Code&amp;hl=en&amp;as_lang=python&amp;as_license_restrict=i&amp;as_license=&amp;as_package=&amp;as_filename=&amp;as_case="">lots</a> of 3rd-party modules, so it's the quasi-standard.</p>

<p>Edit: as mentioned by S.Lott (Thank you!), <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"">PEP 8</a> says it explicitly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version Bookkeeping</p>

  do it as follows.</p>

<pre><code>    __version__ = ""$Revision: 63990 $""
    # $Source$
</code></pre>
  
  <p>These lines should be included after the module's docstring, before
  any other code, separated by a blank line above and below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should also make sure that the version number conforms to the format described in <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/"">PEP 440</a> (<a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/"">PEP 386</a> a previous version of this standard).</p>

","<p><code>file()</code> is a type, like an int or a list. <code>open()</code> is a function for opening files, and will return a <code>file</code> object.</p>

<p>This is an example of when you should use open:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(filename, 'r')
for line in f:
    process(line)
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of when you should use file:</p>

<pre><code>class LoggingFile(file):
    def write(self, data):
        sys.stderr.write(""Wrote %d bytes\n"" % len(data))
        super(LoggingFile, self).write(data)
</code></pre>

","<p>Functionally, the two are the same; <code>open</code> will call <code>file</code> anyway, so currently the difference is a matter of style. The <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python docs</a> recommend using <code>open</code>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When opening a file, it's preferable to use open() instead of invoking the file constructor directly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason is that in future versions they is not guaranteed to be the same (<code>open</code> will become a factory function, which returns objects of  different types depending on the path it's opening).</p>

","<p>Two reasons: The python philosophy of ""There ought to be one way to do it"" and <code>file</code> is going away.</p>

<p><code>file</code> is the actual type (using e.g. <code>file('myfile.txt')</code> is calling its constructor). <code>open</code> is a factory function that will return a file object.</p>

<p>In python 3.0 <code>file</code> is going to move from being a built-in to being implemented by multiple classes in the <code>io</code> library (somewhat similar to Java with buffered readers, etc.)</p>

","<p>Only ever use open() for opening files. file() is actually being removed in 3.0, and it's deprecated at the moment. They've had a sort of strange relationship, but file() is going now, so there's no need to worry anymore.</p>

","<p>The ellipsis is used to slice higher-dimensional data structures. </p>

<p>It's designed to mean <em>at this point, insert as many full slices (<code>:</code>) to extend the multi-dimensional slice to all dimensions</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy import arange
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = arange(16).reshape(2,2,2,2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have a 4-dimensional matrix of order 2x2x2x2. To select all first elements in the 4th dimension, you can use the ellipsis notation</p>

array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14])

","<p>This is another use for Ellipsis, which has nothing to do with slices: I often use it in intra-thread communication with queues, as a mark that signals ""Done""; it's there, it's an object, it's a singleton, and its name means ""lack of"", and it's not the overused None (which could be put in a queue as part of normal data flow).

","<p>In general, you might expect tuples to be slightly faster. However you should definitely test your specific case (if the difference might impact the performance of your program --  remember ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"").</p>

<p>Python makes this very easy: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html"">timeit</a> is your friend.</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m timeit ""x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)""
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0388 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit ""x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]""
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.363 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m timeit -s ""x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)"" ""y=x[3]""
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0938 usec per loop

10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0649 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>So in this case, instantiation is almost an order of magnitude faster for the tuple, but item access is actually somewhat faster for the list! So if you're creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.</p>

<p>Of course if you want to <em>change</em> an item, the list will definitely be faster since you'd need to create an entire new tuple to change one item of it (since tuples are immutable).</p>

","<p>Tuples, being immutable, are more memory efficient; lists, for efficiency, overallocate memory in order to allow appends without constant <code>realloc</code>s. So, if you want to iterate through a constant sequence of values in your code (eg <code>for direction in 'up', 'right', 'down', 'left':</code>), tuples are preferred, since such tuples are pre-calculated in compile time.</p>

<p>Access speeds should be the same (they are both stored as contiguous arrays in the memory).</p>

<p>But, <code>alist.append(item)</code> is much preferred to <code>atuple+= (item,)</code> when you deal with mutable data. Remember, tuples are intended to be treated as records without field names.</p>

","<p>Correctly detecting the encoding all times is <strong>impossible</strong>.</p>

<p>(From chardet FAQ:)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, some encodings are optimized
  for specific languages, and languages
  are not random. Some character
  sequences pop up all the time, while
  other sequences make no sense. A
  person fluent in English who opens a
  newspaper and finds âtxzqJv 2!dasd0a
  QqdKjvzâ will instantly recognize that
  that isn't English (even though it is
  composed entirely of English letters).
  By studying lots of âtypicalâ text, a
  computer algorithm can simulate this
  kind of fluency and make an educated
  guess about a text's language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is the <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet"">chardet</a> library that uses that study to try to detect encoding. chardet is a port of the auto-detection code in Mozilla. </p>

<p>You can also use <a href=""http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html#Beautiful%20Soup%20Gives%20You%20Unicode,%20Dammit"">UnicodeDammit</a>. It will try the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>An encoding discovered in the document itself: for instance, in an XML declaration or (for HTML documents) an http-equiv META tag. If Beautiful Soup finds this kind of encoding within the document, it parses the document again from the beginning and gives the new encoding a try. The only exception is if you explicitly specified an encoding, and that encoding actually worked: then it will ignore any encoding it finds in the document.</li>
<li>An encoding sniffed by looking at the first few bytes of the file. If an encoding is detected at this stage, it will be one of the UTF-* encodings, EBCDIC, or ASCII.</li>
<li>An encoding sniffed by the <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet"">chardet</a> library, if you have it installed.</li>

8,31340,18,71,python,"How do threads work in Python, and what are common Python-threading specific pitfalls?","<p>I've been trying to wrap my head around how threads work in Python, and it's hard to find good information on how they operate. I may just be missing a link or something, but it seems like the official documentation isn't very thorough on the subject, and I haven't been able to find a good write-up.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, only one thread can be running at once, and the active thread switches every 10 instructions or so?</p>

<p>Where is there a good explanation, or can you provide one? It would also be very nice to be aware of common problems that you run into while using threads with Python.</p>
","<p>Below is a basic threading sample. It will spawn 20 threads; each thread will output its thread number. Run it and observe the order in which they print.</p>

<pre><code>import threading
class Foo (threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.__x = x
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
    def run (self):
          print str(self.__x)

for x in xrange(20):
    Foo(x).start()
</code></pre>

<p>As you have hinted at Python threads are implemented through time-slicing. This is how they get the ""parallel"" effect. </p>

<p>In my example my Foo class extends thread, I then implement the <code>run</code> method, which is where the code that you would like to run in a thread goes. To start the thread you call <code>start()</code> on the thread object, which will automatically invoke the <code>run</code> method...</p>

<p>Of course, this is just the very basics. You will eventually want to learn about semaphores, mutexes, and locks for thread synchronization and message passing.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, only one thread can be running at once, and the active thread switches every 10 instructions or so?</p>

<p>Where is there a good explanation, or can you provide one? It would also be very nice to be aware of common problems that you run into while using threads with Python.</p>
","<p>Yes, because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) there can only run one thread at a time. Here are some links with some insights about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235</a></li>

</ul>

<p>From the last link an interesting quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me explain what all that means. 
  Threads run inside the same virtual
  machine, and hence run on the same
  physical machine.  Processes can run
  on the same physical machine or in
  another physical machine.  If you
  architect your application around
  threads, youâve done nothing to access
  multiple machines.  So, you can scale
  to as many cores are on the single
  machine (which will be quite a few
  over time), but to really reach web
  scales, youâll need to solve the
  multiple machine problem anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to use multi core, <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0371/"">pyprocessing</a> defines an process based API to do real parallelization. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Enhancement_Proposal#Development"">PEP</a> also includes some interesting benchmarks.</p>

","<p>Python's a fairly easy language to thread in, but there are caveats.  The biggest thing you need to know about is the Global Interpreter Lock.  This allows only one thread to access the interpreter.  This means two things:  1)  you rarely ever find yourself using a lock statement in python and 2) if you want to take advantage of multi-processor systems, you have to use separate processes.  EDIT:  I should also point out that you can put some of the code in C/C++ if you want to get around the GIL as well.</p>

<p>Thus, you need to re-consider why you want to use threads.  If you want to parallelize your app to take advantage of dual-core architecture, you need to consider breaking your app up into multiple processes.</p>

<p>If you want to improve responsiveness, you should CONSIDER using threads.  There are other alternatives though, namely <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microthread"" rel=""nofollow"">microthreading</a>.  There are also some frameworks that you should look into:</p>

<p>Edit (I seem to have been confused about what the actual question was):</p>

<p>You'll notice that <code>password_reset</code> takes a named parameter called <code>template_name</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def password_reset(request, is_admin_site=False, 
            template_name='registration/password_reset_form.html',
            email_template_name='registration/password_reset_email.html',
            password_reset_form=PasswordResetForm, 
            token_generator=default_token_generator,
            post_reset_redirect=None):
</code></pre>

<p>Check <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset"">password_reset</a> for more information.</p>

<p>... thus, with a urls.py like:</p>

<pre><code>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
from django.contrib.auth.views import password_reset

urlpatterns = patterns('',
     (r'^/accounts/password/reset/$', password_reset, {'template_name': 'my_templates/password_reset.html'}),
     ...
)
</code></pre>

<p><code>django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset</code> will be called for URLs matching <code>'/accounts/password/reset'</code> with the keyword argument <code>template_name = 'my_templates/password_reset.html'</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you don't need to provide any context as the <code>password_reset</code> view takes care of itself. If you want to see what context you have available, you can trigger a <code>TemplateSyntax</code> error and look through the stack trace find the frame with a local variable named <code>context</code>.

<p>In summary: what do you need to do to use your own template? Provide a <code>template_name</code> keyword argument to the view when it is called. You can supply keyword arguments to views by including a dictionary as the third member of a URL pattern tuple.</p>

","<p>Use a pid file.  You have some known location, ""/path/to/pidfile"" and at startup you do something like this (partially pseudocode because I'm pre-coffee and don't want to work all that hard):</p>

<pre><code>import os, os.path
pidfilePath = """"""/path/to/pidfile""""""
if os.path.exists(pidfilePath):
   pidfile = open(pidfilePath,""r"")
   pidString = pidfile.read()
   if &lt;pidString is equal to os.getpid()&gt;:
      # something is real weird
      Sys.exit(BADCODE)
   else:
      &lt;use ps or pidof to see if the process with pid pidString is still running&gt;
      if  &lt;process with pid == 'pidString' is still running&gt;:
          Sys.exit(ALREADAYRUNNING)
      else:
          # the previous server must have crashed
          &lt;log server had crashed&gt;
          &lt;reopen pidfilePath for writing&gt;
          pidfile.write(os.getpid())
else:
    &lt;open pidfilePath for writing&gt;
    pidfile.write(os.getpid())
</code></pre>

<p>So, in other words, you're checking if a pidfile exists; if not, write your pid to that file.  If the pidfile does exist, then check to see if the pid is the pid of a running process; if so, then you've got another live process running, so just shut down.  If not, then the previous process crashed, so log it, and then write your own pid to the file in place of the old one.  Then continue.</p>

","<p>Using a lock-file is a quite common approach on unix.  If it crashes, you have to clean up manually.  You could stor the PID in the file, and on startup check if there is a process with this PID, overriding the lock-file if not.  (However, you also need a lock around the read-file-check-pid-rewrite-file).  You will find what you need for getting and checking pid in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/os.html"" rel=""nofollow"">os</a>-package.  The common way of checking if there exists a process with a given pid, is to send it a non-fatal signal.</p>

<p>Other alternatives could be combining this with flock or posix semaphores.</p>

<p>This is a problem since I don't control either the generation of the <code>d_args</code>, or the <code>example</code> function.. They both come from external modules, and <code>example</code> only accepts some of the keyword-arguments from the dict..</p>

<p>Ideally I would just do</p>

<pre><code>parsed_kwargs = feedparser.parse(the_url)
valid_kwargs = get_valid_kwargs(parsed_kwargs, valid_for = PyRSS2Gen.RSS2)

<p>I will probably just filter the dict, from a list of valid keyword-arguments, but I was wondering: <strong>Is there a way to programatically list the keyword arguments the a specific function takes?</strong></p>
","<p>A little nicer than inspecting the code object directly and working out the variables is to use the inspect module.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a,b,c=42, *args, **kwargs): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(func)
(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'args', 'kwargs', (42,))
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to know if its callable with a particular set of args, you need the args without a default already specified.  These can be got by:</p>

<pre><code>def getRequiredArgs(func):
    args, varargs, varkw, defaults = inspect.getargspec(func)
    if defaults:
        args = args[:-len(defaults)]
    return args   # *args and **kwargs are not required, so ignore them.
</code></pre>

<p>Then a function to tell what you are missing from your particular dict is:</p>

<pre><code>def missingArgs(func, argdict):
    return set(getRequiredArgs(func)).difference(argdict)
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, to check for invalid args, use:</p>

<pre><code>def invalidArgs(func, argdict):
    args, varargs, varkw, defaults = inspect.getargspec(func)
    if varkw: return set()  # All accepted
    return set(argdict) - set(args)
</code></pre>

<p>And so a full test if it is callable is :</p>

<pre><code>def isCallableWithArgs(func, argdict):
    return not missingArgs(func, argdict) and not invalidArgs(func, argdict)
</code></pre>

<p>(This is good only as far as python's arg parsing.  Any runtime checks for invalid values in kwargs obviously can't be detected.)</p>

<p>This is because first <code>co_varnames</code> are always parameters (next are local variables, like <code>y</code> in the example above).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; func(**getValidArgs(func, args))
</code></pre>

<p><hr></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A small addition: if you <strong>really need only keyword arguments</strong> of a function, you can use the <code>func_defaults</code> attribute to extract them:</p>

<pre><code>def getValidKwargs(func, argsDict):
    validArgs = func.func_code.co_varnames[:func.func_code.co_argcount]

                if key in validKwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>You could now call your function with known args, but extracted kwargs, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>func(param1, param2, **getValidKwargs(func, kwargsDict))
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that <code>func</code> uses no <code>*args</code> or <code>**kwargs</code> magic in its signature.</p>

pixels[
  pixel_position * pixel_byte_width :
  (pixel_position + 1) * pixel_byte_width] = array.array('B', new_pixel_value)

My main interest would be something that is justifiable to the employer as an expense.
That is, I am looking for justifications for the employer to finance the learning of a dynamic language. Aside from the obvious that the employee will have broader view, the

","<p>A lot of times some quick task comes up that isn't part of the main software you are developing.  Sometimes the task is one off ie compare this file to the database and let me know the differences.  It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/Ruby/Python than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).  It will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using Perl/Ruby/Python (or maybe even vbscript <em>cringe</em> and then load it into the database than it would to create a Java/C# program to do it or to do it by hand.</p>

<p>Also, due to the ease at which most of the dynamic languages parse text, they are great for code generation.  Sure your final project must be in C#/Java/Transact SQL but instead of cutting and pasting 100 times, finding errors, and cutting and pasting another 100 times it is often (but not always) easier just to use a code generator.</p>

<p>A recent example at work is we needed to get data from one accounting system into our accounting system.  The system has an import format, but the old system had a completely different format (fixed width although some things had to be matched).  The task is not to create a program to migrate the data over and over again.  It is to shove the data into our system and then maintain it there going forward.  So even though we are a C# and SQL Server shop, I used Python to convert the data into the format that could be imported by our application.  Ultimately it doesn't matter that I used python, it matters that the data is in the system.  My boss was pretty impressed.</p>

<p>Where I often see the dynamic languages used for is testing.  It is much easier to create a Python/Perl/Ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent Java program.  You can also use python to hit against command line programs, generate a ton of garbage (but still valid) test data, etc.. quite easily.</p>

<p>The other thing that dynamic languages are big on is code generation.  Creating the C#/C++/Java code.  Some examples follow:</p>

<p>The first code generation task I often see is people using dynamic languages to maintain constants in the system.  Instead of hand coding a bunch of enums, a dynamic language can be used to fairly easily parse a text file and create the Java/C# code with the enums.</p>

<p>SQL is a whole other ball game but often you get better performance by cut and pasting 100 times instead of trying to do a function (due to caching of execution plans or putting complicated logic in a function causing you to go row by row instead of in a set).  In fact it is quite useful to use the table definition to create certain stored procedures automatically.</p>

<p>It is always better to get buy in for a code generator.  But even if you don't, is it more fun to spend time cutting/pasting or is it more fun to create a Perl/Python/Ruby script once and then have that generate the code?  If it takes you hours to hand code something but less time to create a code generator, then even if you use it once you have saved time and hence money.  If it takes you longer to create a code generator than it takes to hand code once but you know you will have to update the code more than once, it may still make sense.  If it takes you 2 hours to hand code, 4 hours to do the generator but you know you'll have to hand code equivalent work another 5 or 6 times than it is obviously better to create the generator.</p>

<p>Also some things are easier with dynamic languages than Java/C#/C/C++.  In particular regular expressions come to mind.  If you start using regular expressions in Perl and realize their value, you may suddenly start making use of the Java regular expression library if you haven't before.  If you have then there may be something else.</p>

<p>I will leave you with one last example of a task that would have been great for a dynamic language.  My work mate had to take a directory full of files and burn them to various cd's for various customers.  There were a few customers but a lot of files and you had to look in them to see what they were.  He did this task by hand....A Java/C# program would have saved time, but for one time and with all the development overhead it isn't worth it.  However slapping something together in Perl/Python/Ruby probably would have been worth it.  He spent several hours doing it.  It would have taken less than one to create the Python script to inspect each file, match which customer it goes to, and then move the file to the appropriate place.....Again, not part of the standard job.  But the task came up as a one off.  Is it better to do it yourself, spend the larger amount of time to make Java/C# do the task, or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in Python/Perl/Ruby.  If you are using C or C++ the point is even more dramatic due to the extra concerns of programming in C or C++ (pointers, no array bounds checking, etc.).</p>

","<p>Dynamic languages are fantastic for prototyping ideas. Often for performance reasons they won't work for permanent solutions or products. <em>But</em>, with languages like Python, which allow you to embed standard C/C++/Java inside them or visa versa, you can speed up the really critical bits but leave it glued together with the flexibility of a dynamic language.</p>

<p>...and so you get the best of both worlds.

","<p>Knowing grep and ruby made it possible to narrow down a problem, and verify the fix for, an issue involving tons of java exceptions on some production servers. Because I threw the solution together in ruby, it was done (designed, implemented, tested, run, bug-fixed, re-run, enhanced, results analyzed) in an afternoon instead of a couple of days. I could have solved the same problem using an all-java solution or a C# solution, but it most likely would have taken me longer.</p>

<p>Having dynamic language expertise also sometimes leads you to simpler solutions in less dynamic languages. In ruby, perl or python, you just intuitively reach for associative arrays (hashes, dictionaries, whatever word you want to use) for the smallest things, where you might be tempted to create a complex class hierarchy in a statically typed language when the problem doesn't necessarily demand it.</p>

<p>Plus you can plug in most scripting languages into most runtimes. So it doesn't have to be either/or.</p>

","<p>They're useful for the ""Quick Hack"" that is for plugging a gap in your main language for a quick (and potentially dirty) fix faster than it would take to develop the same in your main language. An example: a simple script in perl to go through a large text file and replace all instances of an email address with another is trivial with an amount of time taken in the 10 minute range. Hacking a console app together to do the same in your main language would take multiples of that.</p>

<p>You also have the benefit that exposing yourself to additional languages broadens your abilities and learning to attack problems from a different languages perspective can be as valuable as the language itself.</p>

<p>Finally, scripting languages are very useful in the realm of extension. Take LUA as an example. You can bolt a lua interpreter into your app with very little overhead and you now have a way to create rich scripting functionality that can be exposed to end users or altered and distributed quickly without requiring a rebuild of the entire app. This is used to great effect in many games most notably World of Warcraft.</p>

","<p>Learning a new language is a long-term process. In a couple of days you'll learn the basics, yes. But! As you probably know, the real practical applicability of any language is tied to the standard library and other available components. Learning how to use the efficiently requires a lot of hands-on experience. </p>

<p>Perhaps the only immediate short-term benefit is that developers learn to distinguish the nails that need a Python/Perl/Ruby -hammer. And, if they are any good, they can then study some more (online, perhaps!) and become real experts.</p>

<p>The long-term benefits are easier to imagine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The employee becomes a better developer. Better developer => better quality. We are living in a knowledge economy these days. It's wiser to invest in those brains that already work for you.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easier to adapt when the next big language emerges. It is very likely that the NBL will have many of the features present in today's scripting languages: first-class functions, closures, streams/generators, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>New market possibilities and ability to respond more quickly. Even if you are not writing Python, <em>other people are</em>. Your clients? Another vendor in the project? Perhaps a critical component was written in some other language? It will cost money and time, if you do not have people who can understand the code and interface with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Recruitment. If your company has a reputation of teaching new and interesting stuff to people, it will be easier to recruit the top people. <em>Everyone</em> is doing Java/C#/C++. It is not a very effective way to differentiate yourself in the job market.</p></li>

<p>Over a decade ago, when I was learning the ways of the Computer, the Old Wise Men With Beards explained how C and C++ are the tools of the industry. No one used Pascal and only the foolhardy would risk their companies with assembler.</p>

<p>And of course, <strong>no one would even mention the awful slow ugly thing called Java</strong>. It will not be a tool for serious business.</p>

<p>So. Um. Replace the languages in the above story and perhaps you can predict the future. Perhaps you can't. Point is, Java will not be the Last Programming Language ever and also you will most likely switch employers as well. The future is charging at you 24 hours per day. Be prepared.</p>

<p>Learning new languages is good for you. Also, in some cases it can give you bragging rights for a long time. My first university course was in Scheme.

","<p>I primarily program in Java and C# but use dynamic languages (ruby/perl) to support smoother deployment, kicking off OS tasks, automated reporting, some log parsing, etc.</p>

<p>After a short time learning and experimenting with ruby or perl you should be able to write some regex manipulating scripts that can alter data formats or grab information from logs.   An example of a small ruby/perl script that could be written quickly would be a script to parse a very large log file and report out only a few events of interest in either a human readable format or a csv format. </p>

<p>Also, having experience with a variety of different programming languages should help you think of new ways to tackle problems in more structured languages like Java, C++, and C#.</p>

","<p>Paul Graham posted an article several years ago about why Python programmers made better Java programmers. (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, regardless of whether the new language is relevant to the company's current methodology, learning a new language means learning new ideas. Someone who is willing to learn a language that isn't considered ""business class"" means that he is interested in programming, beyond just earning a paycheck.</p>

<p>To quote Paul's site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And people don't learn Python because
  it will get them a job; they learn it
  because they genuinely like to program
  and aren't satisfied with the
  languages they already know.</p>
  
  <p>Which makes them exactly the kind of
  programmers companies should want to
  hire. Hence what, for lack of a better
  name, I'll call the Python paradox: if
  a company chooses to write its
  software in a comparatively esoteric
  language, they'll be able to hire
  better programmers, because they'll
  attract only those who cared enough to
  learn it. And for programmers the
  paradox is even more pronounced: the
  language to learn, if you want to get
  a good job, is a language that people
  don't learn merely to get a job.</p>

","<p>The ""real benefit"" that an employer could see is a better programmer who can implement solutions faster; however, you will not be able to provide any hard numbers to justify the expense and an employer will most likely have you work on what makes money now as opposed to having you work on things that make the future better. </p>

Smallest possible footprint -- only binary data, no markup at all. Serialization/deserialization is very fast too.</p>

<p>But for me, integer division's a gotcha:</p>

2
</code></pre>

<p>You probably wanted:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5*1.0/2
2.5
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want this (C-like) behaviour, you should write:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5//2
2
</code></pre>

<p>As that will work with floats too (and it will work when you eventually go to <a href=""http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#integers"">Python 3</a>):</p>

","<p>You should be aware of how class variables are handled in Python. Consider the following class hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>class AAA(object):
    x = 1

class BBB(AAA):
    pass

class CCC(AAA):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Now, check the output of the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
1 1 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; BBB.x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
1 2 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA.x = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
3 2 3
</code></pre>

<p>Surprised? You won't be if you remember that class variables are internally handled as dictionaries of a class object. If a variable name is not found in the dictionary of current class, the parent classes are searched for it. So, the following code again, but with explanations:</p>

<pre><code># AAA: {'x': 1}, BBB: {}, CCC: {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
1 1 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; BBB.x = 2
# AAA: {'x': 1}, BBB: {'x': 2}, CCC: {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
1 2 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; AAA.x = 3
# AAA: {'x': 3}, BBB: {'x': 2}, CCC: {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print AAA.x, BBB.x, CCC.x
3 2 3
</code></pre>

<p>Same goes for handling class variables in class instances (treat this example as a continuation of the one above):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = AAA()
# a: {}, AAA: {'x': 3}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a.x, AAA.x
3 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.x = 4
# a: {'x': 4}, AAA: {'x': 3}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a.x, AAA.x

","<p><strong>Expressions in default arguments are calculated when the function is defined, <em>not</em> when itâs called.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> consider defaulting an argument to the current time:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; def report(when=time.time()):
...     print when
...

<p>I am of the mind that you almost never need to use metaclasses. Why? because I figure if you are doing something like that to a class, you should probably be doing it to an object. And a small redesign/refactor is in order.</p>

<p>Being able to use metaclasses has caused a lot of people in a lot of places to use classes as some kind of second rate object, which just seems disastrous to me.

<p>So please, I am desperate to know your valid (concrete) use-cases for metaclasses in Python. Or to be enlightened as to why mutating classes is better than mutating objects, sometimes.</p>

<p>I will start:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes when using a third-party
  library it is useful to be able to
  mutate the class in a certain way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(this is the only case I can think of, and it's not concrete)</p>
","<p>The purpose of metaclasses isn't to replace the class/object distinction with metaclass/class - it's to change the behaviour of class definitions (and thus their instances) in some way.  Effectively it's to alter the behaviour of the class statement in ways that may be more useful for your particular domain than the default.  The things I have used them for are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tracking subclasses, usually to register handlers.  This is handy when using a plugin style setup, where you wish to register a handler for a particular thing simply by subclassing and setting up a few class attributes.  eg.  suppose you write a handler for various music formats, where each class implements appropriate methods (play / get tags etc) for its type.  Adding a handler for a new type becomes:</p>

<pre><code>class Mp3File(MusicFile):
    extensions = ['.mp3']  # Register this type as a handler for mp3 files
    ...
    # Implementation of mp3 methods go here
</code></pre>

<p>The metaclass then maintains a dictionary of <code>{'.mp3' : MP3File, ... }</code> etc, and constructs an object of the appropriate type when you request a handler through a factory function.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing behaviour.  You may want to attach a special meaning to certain attributes, resulting in altered behaviour when they are present.  For example, you may want to look for methods with the name <code>_get_foo</code> and <code>_set_foo</code> and transparently convert them to properties.  As a real-world example, <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/498149/"">here's</a> a recipe I wrote to give more C-like struct definitions.  The metaclass is used to convert the declared items into a struct format string, handling inheritance etc, and produce a class capable of dealing with it.</p>

<p>For other real-world examples, take a look at various ORMs, like <a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"">sqlalchemy's</a> ORM or <a href=""http://www.sqlobject.org/"">sqlobject</a>.  Again, the purpose is to interpret defintions (here SQL column definitions) with a particular meaning.</p></li>

","<p>The only time I used metaclasses in Python was when writing a wrapper for the Flickr API. </p>

<p>My goal was to scrape <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">flickr's api site</a> and dynamically generate a complete class hierarchy to allow API access using Python objects:</p>

<pre><code># Both the photo type and the flickr.photos.search API method 
# are generated at ""run-time""
for photo in flickr.photos.search(text=balloons):
    print photo.description
</code></pre>

<p>So in that example, because I generated the entire Python Flickr API from the website, I really don't know the class definitions at runtime. Being able to dynamically generate types was very useful.  </p>

Here's what it says:</p>

<p>The most interesting part to me, was...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... but I'm not sure exactly what this means. It says it should <em>look</em> like an expression which can be used to recreate the object, but does that mean it should just be an example of the sort of expression you could use, or should it be an actual expression, that can be executed (eval etc..) to recreate the object? Or... should it be just a rehasing of the actual expression which was used, for pure information purposes?</p>

<p>In general I'm a bit confused as to exactly what I should be putting here.</p>

<p>Wow, that's a lot of hand-wringing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An ""an example of the sort of expression you could use"" would not be a representation of a specific object.  That can't be useful or meaningful.  </p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between ""an actual expression, that can ... recreate the object"" and ""a rehasing of the actual expression which was used [to create the object]""? Both are an expression that creates the object.  There's no practical distinction between these.  A repr call could produce either a new expression or the original expression.  In many cases, they're the same.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this isn't always possible, practical or desirable.</p>

<p>In some cases, you'll notice that repr() presents a string which is clearly <em>not</em> an expression of any kind.  The default repr() for any class you define isn't useful as an expression.</p>

<p>In some cases, you might have mutual (or circular) references between objects.  The repr() of that tangled hierarchy can't make sense.</p>

<p>In many cases, an object is built incrementally via a parser.  For example, from XML or JSON or something.  What would the repr be?  The original XML or JSON?  Clearly not, since they're not Python.  It could be some Python expression that generated the XML.  However, for a gigantic XML document, it might not be possible to write a single Python expression that was the functional equivalent of parsing XML.</p>

","<p><strong>Guideline:</strong> If you can succinctly provide an <em>exact representation</em>, <strong>format it as a Python expression</strong> (which implies that it can be both eval'd and copied directly into source code, in the right context). If providing an <em>inexact representation</em>, <strong>use <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> format</strong>.</p>

<p>There are many possible representations for any value, but the one that's most interesting for Python programmers is an expression that recreates the value.  Remember that <strong>those who understand Python are the target audience</strong>&mdash;and that's also why inexact representations should include relevant context.  Even the default <code>&lt;XXX object at 0xNNN&gt;</code>, while almost entirely useless, still provides type, <code>id()</code> (to distinguish different objects), and indication that no better representation is available.</p>

  (c.l.p post 2002-12-22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having said that, I have (periodically) run across true uses of metaclasses. The one that comes to mind is in Django where all of your models inherit from models.Model. models.Model, in turn, does some serious magic to wrap your DB models with Django's ORM goodness.

905,452300,24,51,python,Python object.__repr__(self) should be an expression?,"<p>I was looking at the builtin object methods in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types"">Python documentation</a>, and I was interested in the documentation for <code>object.__repr__(self)</code>. Here's what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Called by the repr() built-in function
  and by string conversions (reverse
  quotes) to compute the âofficialâ
  string representation of an object. If
  at all possible, this should look like
  a valid Python expression that could
  be used to recreate an object with the
  same value (given an appropriate
  environment). If this is not possible,
  a string of the form &lt;...some useful
  description...> should be returned.
  The return value must be a string
  object. If a class defines <strong>repr</strong>()
  but not <strong>str</strong>(), then <strong>repr</strong>() is
  also used when an âinformalâ string
  representation of instances of that
  class is required.</p>
  
  <p>This is typically used for debugging,
  so it is important that the
  representation is information-rich and
  unambiguous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most interesting part to me, was...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... but I'm not sure exactly what this means. It says it should <em>look</em> like an expression which can be used to recreate the object, but does that mean it should just be an example of the sort of expression you could use, or should it be an actual expression, that can be executed (eval etc..) to recreate the object? Or... should it be just a rehasing of the actual expression which was used, for pure information purposes?</p>

<p>In general I'm a bit confused as to exactly what I should be putting here.</p>
","<p>It should be a Python expression that, when eval'd, creates an object with the exact same properties as this one. For example, if you have a <code>Fraction</code> class that contains two integers, a numerator and denominator, your <code>__repr__()</code> method would look like this:</p>

<pre><code># in the definition of Fraction class
def __repr__(self):
    return ""Fraction(%d, %d)"" % (self.numerator, self.denominator)
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that the constructor takes those two values.</p>

","<p>Metaclasses can be handy for construction of Domain Specific Languages in Python. Concrete examples are Django, SQLObject 's declarative syntax of database schemata. </p>

<p>A basic example from <a href=""http://blog.ianbicking.org/a-conservative-metaclass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">A Conservative Metaclass</a> by Ian Bicking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The metaclasses I've used have been
  primarily to support a sort of
  declarative style of programming. For
  instance, consider a validation
  schema:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>class Registration(schema.Schema):
    first_name = validators.String(notEmpty=True)
    last_name = validators.String(notEmpty=True)
    mi = validators.MaxLength(1)
    class Numbers(foreach.ForEach):
        class Number(schema.Schema):
            type = validators.OneOf(['home', 'work'])
            phone_number = validators.PhoneNumber()

<p>Edit (by Ali): An example of doing this using collections and instances is what I would prefer. The important fact is the instances, which give you more power, and eliminate reason to use metaclasses. Further worth noting that your example uses a mixture of classes and instances, which is surely an indication that you can't just do it all with metaclasses. And creates a truly non-uniform way of doing it.</p>

<pre><code>number_validator = [
    v.OneOf('type', ['home', 'work']),
    v.PhoneNumber('phone_number'),
]

validators = [
    v.String('first_name', notEmpty=True),
    v.String('last_name', notEmpty=True),
    v.MaxLength('mi', 1),
    v.ForEach([number_validator,])
]
</code></pre>

<p>It's not perfect, but already there is almost zero magic, no need for metaclasses, and improved uniformity.</p>

<p>(this is the only case I can think of, and it's not concrete)</p>
","<p>I have a class that handles non-interactive plotting, as a frontend to Matplotlib.  However, on occasion one wants to do interactive plotting.  With only a couple functions I found that I was able to increment the figure count, call draw manually, etc, but I needed to do these before and after every plotting call.  So to create both an interactive plotting wrapper and an offscreen plotting wrapper, I found it was more efficient to do this via metaclasses, wrapping the appropriate methods, than to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>class PlottingInteractive:
    add_slice = wrap_pylab_newplot(add_slice)
</code></pre>

<p>This method doesn't keep up with API changes and so on, but one that iterates over the class attributes in <code>__init__</code> before re-setting the class attributes is more efficient and keeps things up to date:</p>

<pre><code>class _Interactify(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, d):
        super(_Interactify, cls).__init__(name, bases, d)
        for base in bases:
            for attrname in dir(base):
                if attrname in d: continue # If overridden, don't reset
                attr = getattr(cls, attrname)
                if type(attr) == types.MethodType:
                    if attrname.startswith(""add_""):
                        setattr(cls, attrname, wrap_pylab_newplot(attr))
                    elif attrname.startswith(""set_""):
                        setattr(cls, attrname, wrap_pylab_show(attr))
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there might be better ways to do this, but I've found this to be effective.  Of course, this could also be done in <code>__new__</code> or <code>__init__</code>, but this was the solution I found the most straightforward.</p>

","<p>I was thinking the same thing just yesterday and completely agree.  The complications in the code caused by attempts to make it more declarative generally make the codebase harder to maintain, harder to read and less pythonic in my opinion. 
It  also normally requires a lot of copy.copy()ing (to maintain inheritance and to copy from class to instance) and means you have to look in many places to see whats going on (always looking from metaclass up) which goes against the python grain also.
I have been picking through formencode and sqlalchemy code to see if such a declarative style was worth it and its clearly not. Such style should be left to descriptors (such as property and methods) and immutable data.
Ruby has better support for such declarative styles and I am glad the core python  language is not going down that route.</p>

<p>I can see their use for debugging, add a metaclass to all your base classes to get richer info. 
I also see their use only in (very) large projects to get rid of some boilerplate code (but at the loss of clarity).  sqlalchemy for <a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/browser/sqlalchemy/trunk/lib/sqlalchemy/sql/visitors.py"">example</a> does use them elsewhere, to add a particular custom method to all subclasses based on an attribute value in their class definition
e.g a toy example</p>

<pre><code>class test(baseclass_with_metaclass):
    method_maker_value = ""hello""
</code></pre>

<p>could have a metaclass that generated a method in that class with special properties based on ""hello"" (say a method that added ""hello"" to the end of a string). It could be good for maintainability to make sure you did not have to write a method in every subclass you make instead all you have to define is method_maker_value. </p>

<p>The need for this is so rare though and only cuts down on a bit of typing that its not really worth considering unless you have a large enough codebase.</p>

","<p>You can't do this, which is by design.  The Django framework authors intended a strict separation of presentation code from data logic.  Filtering models is data logic, and outputting HTML is presentation logic.</p>

<p>So you have several options.  The easiest is to do the filtering, then pass the result to <code>render_to_response</code>.  Or you could write a method in your model so that you can say <code>{% for object in data.filtered_set %}</code>.  Finally, you could write your own template tag, although in this specific case I would advise against that.</p>

","<p>I run into this problem on a regular basis and often use the ""add a method"" solution. However, there are definitely cases where ""add a method"" or ""compute it in the view"" don't work (or don't work well). E.g. when you are caching template fragments and need some non-trivial DB computation to produce it. You don't want to do the DB work unless you need to, but you won't know if you need to until you are deep in the template logic.</p>

<p>Some other possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the {% expr &lt;expression> as &lt;var_name> %} template tag found at <a href=""http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/9/"">http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/9/</a> The expression is any legal Python expression with your template's Context as your local scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Change your template processor.

It's also faster. You can do this wholesale, or you might limit its use to templates that <em>you</em> are working on, but use Django's ""safer"" templates for designer-maintained pages.</p></li>

","<p>Make sure you really need to invert the matrix.  This is often unnecessary and can be numerically unstable.  When most people ask how to invert a matrix, they really want to know how to solve Ax = b where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors.  It's more efficient and more accurate to use code that solves the equation Ax = b for x directly than to calculate A inverse then multiply the inverse by B.  Even if you need to solve Ax = b for many b values, it's not a good idea to invert A.  If you have to solve the system for multiple b values, save the Cholesky factorization of A, but don't invert it.</p>

","<p>One of the fastest ways to make many with replacement samples from an unchanging list is the alias method.  The core intuition is that we can create a set of equal-sized bins for the weighted list that can be indexed very efficiently through bit operations, to avoid a binary search.  It will turn out that, done correctly, we will need to only store two items from the original list per bin, and thus can represent the split with a single percentage.</p>

<p>Let's us take the example of five equally weighted choices, <code>(a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1, e:1)</code></p>

<p>To create the alias lookup:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Normalize the weights such that they sum to <code>1.0</code>.  <code>(a:0.2 b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code>  This is the probability of choosing each weight.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the number of variables, and create this number of partitions, <code>|p|</code>.  Each partition represents a probability mass of <code>1/|p|</code>.  In this case, we create <code>8</code> partitions, each able to contain <code>0.125</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the variable with the least remaining weight, and place as much of it's mass as possible in an empty partition.  In this example, we see that <code>a</code> fills the first partition.  <code>(p1{a|null,1.0},p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8)</code> with <code>(a:0.075, b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code></p></li>
<li><p>If the partition is not filled, take the variable with the most weight, and fill the partition with that variable.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat steps 3 and 4, until none of the weight from the original partition need be assigned to the list.</p>

<p>For example, if we run another iteration of 3 and 4, we see </p>

<p><code>(p1{a|null,1.0},p2{a|b,0.6},p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8)</code> with <code>(a:0, b:0.15 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code> left to be assigned</p>

<p>At runtime:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a <code>U(0,1)</code> random number, say binary <code>0.001100000</code></p></li>
<li><p>bitshift it <code>lg2(p)</code>, finding the index partition.  Thus, we shift it by <code>3</code>, yielding <code>001.1</code>, or position 1, and thus partition 2.</p></li>
<li><p>If the partition is split, use the decimal portion of the shifted random number to decide the split. In this case, the value is <code>0.5</code>, and <code>0.5 &lt; 0.6</code>, so return <code>a</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""http://prxq.wordpress.com/2006/04/17/the-alias-method/"">Here is some code and another explanation</a>, but unfortunately it doesn't use the bitshifting technique, nor have I actually verified it.</p>

<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"">Aspect-oriented Programming</a> - apply interceptors in a horizontal programming paradigm (instead of vertical OOP inheritance) for things like transactions, security, and caching.</li>
<li>DatabaseTemplate - Reading from the database requires a monotonous cycle of opening cursors, reading rows, and closing cursors, along with exception handlers. With this template class, all you need is the SQL query and row-handling function. Spring Python does the rest.</li>
<li>Database Transactions - Wrapping multiple database calls with transactions can make your code hard to read. This module provides multiple ways to define transactions without making things complicated.</li>
<li>Security - Plugin security interceptors to lock down access to your methods, utilizing both authentication and domain authorization.</li>
<li>Remoting - It is easy to convert your local application into a distributed one. If you have already built your client and server pieces using the IoC container, then going from local to distributed is just a configuration change.</li>
<li>Samples - to help demonstrate various features of Spring Python, some sample applications have been created:
<ul>
<li>PetClinic - Spring Framework's sample web app has been rebuilt from the ground up using python web containers including: <a href=""http://cherrypy.org/"">CherryPy</a>. Go check it out for an example of how to use this framework. (NOTE: Other python web frameworks will be added to this list in the future).</li>
<li>Spring Wiki - Wikis are powerful ways to store and manage content, so we created a simple one as a demo!</li>
<li>Spring Bot - Use Spring Python to build a tiny bot to manage the IRC channel of your open source project.</li>

","<p>Functions only become methods at runtime.  That is, when you get <code>C.f</code> you get a bound function (and <code>C.f.im_class is C</code>).  At the time your function is defined it is just a plain function, it is not bound to any class.  This unbound and disassociated function is what is decorated by logger.</p>

<p><code>self.__class__.__name__</code> will give you the name of the class, but you can also use descriptors to accomplish this in a somewhat more general way.  This pattern is described <a href=""http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/10/24/decorators-and-descriptors/"">in a blog post on Decorators and Descriptors</a>, and an implementation of your logger decorator in particular would look like:</p>

<pre><code>class logger(object):
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    def __get__(self, obj, type=None):
        return self.__class__(self.func.__get__(obj, type))
    def __call__(self, *args, **kw):
        print 'Entering %s' % self.func
        return self.func(*args, **kw)

        return x+y

C().f(1, 2)
# =&gt; Entering &lt;bound method C.f of &lt;__main__.C object at 0x...&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the output can be improved (by using, for example, <code>getattr(self.func, 'im_class', None)</code>), but this general pattern will work for both methods and functions.  However it will <em>not</em> work for old-style classes (but just don't use those ;)</p>

","<p>Claudiu's answer is correct, but you can also cheat by getting the class name off of the <code>self</code> argument.  This will give misleading log statements in cases of inheritance, but will tell you the class of the object whose method is being called.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>from functools import wraps  # use this to preserve function signatures and docstrings
def logger(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def with_logging(*args, **kwargs):
        print ""Entering %s.%s"" % (args[0].__class__.__name__, func.__name__)
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return with_logging

class C(object):
    @logger
    def f(self):
        pass

C().f()
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, this won't work properly in cases where you've inherited a function from a parent class; in this case you might say</p>

<pre><code>class B(C):
    pass

b = B()
b.f()
</code></pre>

<p>and get the message <code>Entering B.f</code> where you actually want to get the message <code>Entering C.f</code> since that's the correct class.  On the other hand, this might be acceptable, in which case I'd recommend this approach over Claudiu's suggestion.</p>

","<p>It seems that while the class is being created, Python creates regular function objects. They only get turned into unbound method objects afterwards. Knowing that, this is the only way I could find to do what you want:</p>

","<p>In the <code>time</code> module, there are two timing functions: <code>time</code> and <code>clock</code>. <code>time</code> gives you ""wall"" time, if this is what you care about.</p>

<p>However, the python <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html"">docs</a> say that <code>clock</code> should be used for benchmarking. Note that <code>clock</code> behaves different in separate systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>on MS Windows, it uses the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(), with ""resolution typically better than a microsecond"". It has no special meaning, it's just a number (it starts counting the first time you call <code>clock</code> in your process).</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    # ms windows
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is wall seconds elapsed (floating point)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>on *nix, <code>clock</code> reports CPU time. Now, this is different, and most probably the value you want, since your program hardly ever is the only process requesting CPU time (even if you have no other processes, the kernel uses CPU time now and then). So, this number, which typically is smallerÂ¹ than the wall time (i.e. time.time() - t0), is more meaningful when benchmarking code:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    # linux
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is CPU seconds elapsed (floating point)
</pre>

<p>Apart from all that, the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html"">timeit</a> module has the <code>Timer</code> class that is supposed to use what's best for benchmarking from the available functionality.</p>

<p>Â¹ unless threading gets in the wayâ¦</p>

<p>Â² Python â¥3.3: there are <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/#id18""><code>time.perf_counter()</code> and <code>time.process_time()</code></a>. <code>perf_counter</code> is being used by the <code>timeit</code> module.</p>

","<p>From the python docs on <code>__import__</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>__import__( name[, globals[, locals[, fromlist[, level]]]])
</code></pre>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>When the name variable is of the form
  package.module, normally, the
  top-level package (the name up till
  the first dot) is returned, not the
  module named by name. However, when a
  non-empty fromlist argument is given,
  the module named by name is returned.
  This is done for compatibility with
  the bytecode generated for the
  different kinds of import statement;
  when using ""import spam.ham.eggs"", the
  top-level package spam  must be placed
  in the importing namespace, but when
  using ""from spam.ham import eggs"", the
  spam.ham subpackage must be used to
  find the eggs variable. As a
  workaround for this behavior, use
  getattr() to extract the desired
  components. For example, you could
  define the following helper:</p>

<pre><code>def my_import(name):
    mod = __import__(name)
    components = name.split('.')
    for comp in components[1:]:
        mod = getattr(mod, comp)
    return mod
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To paraphrase:</strong></p>

<p>When you ask for <code>somepackage.somemodule</code>, <code>__import__</code> returns <code>somepackage.__init__.py</code>, which is often empty.</p>

<p>It will return <code>somemodule</code> if you provide <code>fromlist</code> (a list of the variable names inside <code>somemodule</code> you want, which are not actually returned)</p>

<p>You can also, as I did, use the function they suggest.</p>

","<p>Rather than just punting to C, I'd suggest:</p>

<p>Make your code count. Do more with fewer executions of lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the algorithm to a faster one. It doesn't need to be fancy to be faster in many cases.</li>
<li>Use python primitives that happens to be written in C. Some things will force an interpreter dispatch where some wont. The latter is preferable</li>
<li>Beware of code that first constructs a big data structure followed by its consumation. Think the difference between range and xrange. In general it is often worth thinking about memory usage of the program. Using generators can sometimes bring O(n) memory use down to O(1).</li>
<li>Python is generally non-optimizing. Hoist invariant code out of loops, eliminate common subexpressions where possible in tight loops.</li>
<li>If something is expensive, then precompute or memoize it. Regular expressions can be compiled for instance.</li>
<li>Need to crunch numbers? You might want to check <code>numpy</code> out.</li>
<li>Many python programs are slow because they are bound by disk I/O or database access. Make sure you have something worthwhile to do while you wait on the data to arrive rather than just blocking. A weapon could be something like the <code>Twisted</code> framework.</li>
<li>Note that many crucial data-processing libraries have C-versions, be it XML, JSON or whatnot. They are often considerably faster than the Python interpreter.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all of the above fails for profiled and measured code, then begin thinking about the C-rewrite path.</p>

","<p>The usual suspects -- profile it, find the most expensive line, figure out what it's doing, fix it. If you haven't done much profiling before, there could be some big fat quadratic loops or string duplication hiding behind otherwise innocuous-looking expressions.</p>

<p>In Python, two of the most common causes I've found for non-obvious slowdown are string concatenation and generators. Since Python's strings are immutable, doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>result = u""""
for item in my_list:
    result += unicode (item)
</code></pre>

<p>will copy the <em>entire</em> string twice per iteration. This has been well-covered, and the solution is to use <code>"""".join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>result = """".join (unicode (item) for item in my_list)
</code></pre>

<p>Generators are another culprit. They're very easy to use and can simplify some tasks enormously, but a poorly-applied generator will be much slower than simply appending items to a list and returning the list.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>don't be afraid to rewrite bits in C!</strong> Python, as a dynamic high-level language, is simply not capable of matching C's speed. If there's one function that you can't optimize any more in Python, consider extracting it to an extension module.</p>

<p>My favorite technique for this is to maintain both Python and C versions of a module. The Python version is written to be as clear and obvious as possible -- any bugs should be easy to diagnose and fix. Write your tests against this module. Then write the C version, and test it. Its behavior should in all cases equal that of the Python implementation -- if they differ, it should be very easy to figure out which is wrong and correct the problem.</p>

","<p>Regarding ""Secondly: When writing a program from scratch in python, what are some good ways to greatly improve performance?""</p>

<p>Remember the Jackson rules of optimization: </p>

<ul>
<li>Rule 1: Don't do it.</li>
<li>Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the Knuth rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Premature optimization is the root of all evil.""</li>
</ul>

<p>The more useful rules are in the <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jch/java/rules.html"">General Rules for Optimization</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't optimize as you go.  First get it right.  Then get it fast.  Optimizing a wrong program is still wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember the 80/20 rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Always run ""before"" and ""after"" benchmarks.  Otherwise, you won't know if you've found the 80%.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the right algorithms and data structures.  This rule should be first.  Nothing matters as much as algorithm and data structure.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>You can't prevent or avoid the ""optimize this program"" effort.  It's part of the job.  You have to plan for it and do it carefully, just like the design, code and test activities.</p>

","<p>People have given some good advice, but you have to be aware that when high performance is needed, the python model is: punt to c.  Efforts like psyco may in the future help a bit, but python just isn't a fast language, and it isn't designed to be.  Very few languages have the ability to do the dynamic stuff really well and still generate very fast code; at least for the forseeable future (and some of the design works against fast compilation) that will be the case.</p>

<p>So, if you really find yourself in this bind, your best bet will be to isolate the parts of your system that are unacceptable slow in (good) python, and design around the idea that you'll rewrite those bits in C.  Sorry.  Good design can help make this less painful.  Prototype it in python first though, then you've easily got a sanity check on your c, as well.</p>

<p>This works well enough for things like numpy, after all.  I can't emphasize enough how much good design will help you though.  If you just iteratively poke at your python bits and replace the slowest ones with C, you may end up with a big mess.  Think about exactly where the C bits are needed, and how they can be minimized and encapsulated sensibly.</p>

","<p>The question you've asked (how to iterate through the alphabet) is not the same question as the problem you're trying to solve (how to count the frequency of letters in a string).</p>

<p>You can use string.lowercase, as other posters have suggested:</p>

<pre><code>import string
allTheLetters = string.lowercase
</code></pre>

<p>To do things the way you're ""used to"", treating letters as numbers, you can use the ""ord"" and ""chr"" functions.  There's absolutely no reason to ever do exactly this, but maybe it comes closer to what you're actually trying to figure out:</p>

<pre><code>def getAllTheLetters(begin='a', end='z'):
    beginNum = ord(begin)
    endNum = ord(end)
    for number in xrange(beginNum, endNum+1):
        yield chr(number)
</code></pre>

<p>You can tell it does the right thing because this code prints <code>True</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import string
print ''.join(getAllTheLetters()) == string.lowercase
</code></pre>

<p>But, to solve the problem you're actually trying to solve, you want to use a dictionary and collect the letters as you go:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict    
def letterOccurrances(string):
    frequencies = defaultdict(lambda: 0)
    for character in string:
        frequencies[character.lower()] += 1
    return frequencies
</code></pre>

<p>Use like so:</p>

<pre><code>occs = letterOccurrances(""Hello, world!"")
print occs['l']
print occs['h']
</code></pre>

<p>This will print '3' and '1' respectively.</p>

<p>Note that this works for unicode as well:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
occs = letterOccurrances(u""hÃ©ÄºÄºÃ³, áºÃ³ÅÄºd!"")
print occs[u'l']
print occs[u'Äº']
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to try the other approach on unicode (incrementing through every character) you'd be waiting a long time; there are millions of unicode characters.</p>

<p>To implement your original function (print the counts of each letter in alphabetical order) in terms of this:</p>

<pre><code>def alphCount(text):
    for character, count in sorted(letterOccurrances(text).iteritems()):
        print ""%s: %s"" % (character, count)

alphCount(""hello, world!"")
</code></pre>

879,442040,25,37,python,Pre-populate an inline FormSet?,"<p>I'm working on an attendance entry form for a band.  My idea is to have a section of the form to enter event information for a performance or rehearsal.  Here's the model for the event table:</p>

<pre><code>class Event(models.Model):
    event_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    date = models.DateField()
    event_type = models.ForeignKey(EventType)
    description = models.TextField()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I'd like to have an inline FormSet that links the band members to the event and records whether they were present, absent, or excused:</p>

<pre><code>class Attendance(models.Model):
    attendance_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    event_id = models.ForeignKey(Event)
    member_id = models.ForeignKey(Member)
    attendance_type = models.ForeignKey(AttendanceType)
    comment = models.TextField(blank=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what I'd like to do is to pre-populate this inline FormSet with entries for all the current members and default them to being present (around 60 members).  Unfortunately, Django <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/73af9e58bd7626a8"">doesn't allow initial values in this case.</a></p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>So, you're not going to like the answer, partly because I'm not yet done writing the code and partly because it's a lot of work.</p>

<p>What you need to do, as I discovered when I ran into this myself, is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spend a lot of time reading through the formset and model-formset code to get a feel for how it all works (not helped by the fact that some of the functionality lives on the formset classes, and some of it lives in factory functions which spit them out). You will need this knowledge in the later steps.</li>
<li>Write your own formset class which subclasses from <code>BaseInlineFormSet</code> and accepts <code>initial</code>. The really tricky bit here is that you <em>must</em> override <code>__init__()</code>, and you <em>must</em> make sure that it calls up to <code>BaseFormSet.__init__()</code> rather than using the direct parent or grandparent <code>__init__()</code> (since those are <code>BaseInlineFormSet</code> and <code>BaseModelFormSet</code>, respectively, and neither of them can handle initial data).</li>
<li>Write your own subclass of the appropriate admin inline class (in my case it was <code>TabularInline</code>) and override its <code>get_formset</code> method to return the result of <code>inlineformset_factory()</code> using your custom formset class.</li>
<li>On the actual <code>ModelAdmin</code> subclass for the model with the inline, override <code>add_view</code> and <code>change_view</code>, and replicate most of the code, but with one big change: build the initial data your formset will need, and pass it to your custom formset (which will be returned by your <code>ModelAdmin</code>'s <code>get_formsets()</code> method).</li>
</ol>

<p>I've had a few productive chats with Brian and Joseph about improving this for future Django releases; at the moment, the way the model formsets work just make this more trouble than it's usually worth, but with a bit of API cleanup I think it could be made extremely easy.</p>

<p>An OpenID provider will ask you to give your site (in this case <a href=""http://localhost:8000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8000</a> or similar) access to your identity.

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It turns out that Yahoo do things differently to other OpenID providers that I've come across and disallow redirections to ip address, sites without a correct tld in their domain name and those that run on ports other than 80 or 443.

<p>Finally, would you say that one is more Pythonic than the other?</p>
","<p>I was considering both Pygame and Pyglet for a small 2D shooter, and after looking at source code and some tutorials went with Pyglet. I was very happy with the results.</p>

<p>Pyglet worked immediately and was enjoyable to work with, and conceptually very clean. It certainly had a Pythonic feel to me: you could get a straightforward and readable example going very quickly, and it uses decorators to good effect for event handling. It also didn't force a particular program structure, which made it easy for me to mix in the physics modelling of Pymunk (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pymunk/"">http://code.google.com/p/pymunk/</a>). </p>

<p>While it is based on OpenGL and you can use those features for special effects, I was able to do just fine without any knowledge of them.</p>

<p>It also works well with py2exe and py2app, which is important because a lot of people do not have a Python interpreter installed.</p>

<p>On the downside, there is less information about it on the web because it is newer, as well as fewer sample games to look at. </p>

<p>Also, it changed quite a bit from previous versions, so some of the tutorials which are there are now out of date (there is the ""new style event loop""
and the Sprite class as major additions.)</p>

<p>I would recommend downloading the examples (there is a nice Asteroids clone called Astraea included) and seeing if you like the style. </p>

","<p>This sort of adding-up-scores-by-features is not a good way to choose a programming language. You'd be better off choosing whichever you know the best. If you don't know any of them, try them out for a little while.

","<p>I think it's going to be difficult to get an objective comparison.  I personally prefer Python.  To address one of your criteria, Python was designed from the start to be an embeddable language.  It has a very rich C API, and the interpreter is modularized to make it easy to call from C.  If Java is your host environment, you should look at Jython, an implementation of Python inside the Java environment (VM and libs).</p>

<pre><code>import collections, itertools

def window(it, winsize, step=1):
    """"""Sliding window iterator.""""""
    it=iter(it)  # Ensure we have an iterator
    l=collections.deque(itertools.islice(it, winsize))

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(window([1,2,3,4,5],3))
[(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5)]
</code></pre>

<p>When using in lookahead/behind situations where you also need to deal with numbers without having a next or previous value, you may want pad the sequence with an appropriate value such as None.</p>

<pre><code>l= range(10)
# Print adjacent numbers

However, I need to output XML that contains CDATA sections and there doesn't seem to be a way to do that with ElementTree.</p>

<p>Can it be done?</p>
","<p>After a bit of work, I found the answer myself. Looking at the ElementTree.py source code, I found there was special handling of XML comments and preprocessing instructions. What they do is create a factory function for the special element type that uses a special (non-string) tag value to differentiate it from regular elements.</p>

<pre><code>def Comment(text=None):
    element = Element(Comment)
    element.text = text
    return element
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the <code>_write</code> function of ElementTree that actually outputs the XML, there's a special case handling for comments:</p>

<pre><code>if tag is Comment:
    file.write(""&lt;!-- %s --&gt;"" % _escape_cdata(node.text, encoding))
</code></pre>

<p>In order to support CDATA sections, I create a factory function called <code>CDATA</code>, extended the ElementTree class and changed the <code>_write</code> function to handle the CDATA elements.</p>

<p>This still doesn't help if you want to parse an XML with CDATA sections and then output it again with the CDATA sections, but it at least allows you to create XMLs with CDATA sections programmatically, which is what I needed to do.</p>

<p>The implementation seems to work with both ElementTree and cElementTree.</p>

<pre><code>import elementtree.ElementTree as etree

<p>you should break it into two CDATA's in that case, splitting the <code>]]&gt;</code> between the two.</p>

","<p>From the doc <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file.read"">file.read()</a> (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>file.read([size])</p>
  
  <p>Read at most size bytes from the file (less if the read hits EOF before obtaining size  bytes). If the size argument is negative or omitted, read all data until EOF is reached. <strong>The bytes are returned as a string object</strong>. An empty string is returned when EOF is encountered immediately. (For certain files, like ttys, it makes sense to continue reading after an EOF is hit.) Note that this method may call the underlying C function fread more than once in an effort to acquire as close to size bytes as possible. Also note that when in non-blocking mode, less data than was requested may be returned, even if no size parameter was given.</p>

In any case, I'm assuming all of the minor details can be overcome, either by a gentleman's agreement or some run-time checking. :-)</p>
","<p>I'd use some fancy logging decorator, or a bunch of them:</p>

<pre><code>def doLogging(logTreshold):
    def logFunction(aFunc):
        def innerFunc(*args, **kwargs):
            if LOGLEVEL &gt;= logTreshold:
                print ""&gt;&gt;Called %s at %s""%(aFunc.__name__, time.strftime(""%H:%M:%S""))
                print ""&gt;&gt;Parameters: "", args, kwargs if kwargs else """" 
            try:
                return aFunc(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                print ""&gt;&gt;%s took %s""%(aFunc.__name__, time.strftime(""%H:%M:%S""))
        return innerFunc
    return logFunction
</code></pre>

<p>All you need is to declare LOGLEVEL constant in each module (or just globally and just import it in all modules) and then you can use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>@doLogging(2.5)
def myPreciousFunction(one, two, three=4):
    print ""I'm doing some fancy computations :-)""
    return
</code></pre>

<p>And if LOGLEVEL is no less than 2.5 you'll get output like this:  </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;Called myPreciousFunction at 18:49:13
&gt;&gt;Parameters:  (1, 2) 
I'm doing some fancy computations :-)
&gt;&gt;myPreciousFunction took 18:49:13
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, some work is needed for better handling of kwargs, so the default values will be printed if they are present, but that's another question.</p>

<p>You should probably use some <strong><code>logger</code></strong> module instead of raw <strong><code>print</code></strong> statements, but I wanted to focus on the decorator idea and avoid making code too long.</p>

<p>Anyway - with such decorator you get function-level logging, arbitrarily many log levels, ease of application to new function, and to disable logging you only need to set LOGLEVEL. And you can define different output streams/files for each function if you wish. You can write doLogging as:</p>

<pre><code> def doLogging(logThreshold, outStream=sys.stdout):
      .....
      print &gt;&gt;outStream, ""&gt;&gt;Called %s at %s"" etc.
</code></pre>

<p>And utilize log files defined on a per-function basis.</p>

","<p>As an imperfect shortcut, how about mocking out <code>logging</code> in specific modules using something like <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MiniMock/"" rel=""nofollow"">MiniMock</a>?</p>

<pre><code>import logging
class C(object):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        logging.info(""Instantiating"")

<pre><code>from minimock import Mock
import my_module
my_module.logging = Mock('logging')
c = my_module.C()
</code></pre>

<p>You'd only have to do this once, before the initial import of the module.</p>

<p>Getting the level specific behaviour would be simple enough by mocking specific methods, or having <code>logging.getLogger</code> return a mock object with some methods impotent and others  delegating to the real <code>logging</code> module.</p>

<p>In practice, you'd probably want to replace MiniMock with something simpler and faster; at the very least something which doesn't print usage to stdout! Of course, this doesn't handle the problem of module A importing <code>logging</code> from module B (and hence A also importing the log granularity of B)...</p>

<p>This will never be as fast as not running the log statements at all, but should be much faster than going all the way into the depths of the logging module only to discover this record shouldn't be logged after all.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
y = groupby(x, itemgetter(1))

<p>Now y is an iterator containing tuples of (element, item iterator). It's more confusing to explain these tuples than it is to show code:</p>

    print(elt, items)

<li><p><a href=""http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>TagSoup</strong></a>, an open-source program, is a Java and SAX - based tool, developed by <a href=""http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>John Cowan</strong></a>. This is 
a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the wild: poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short. TagSoup is designed for people who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied to even the worst HTML. TagSoup also includes a command-line processor that reads HTML files and can generate either clean HTML or well-formed XML that is a close approximation to XHTML.<br>
<a href=""http://www.jezuk.co.uk/arabica/log?id=3591"" rel=""nofollow"">Taggle</a> is a commercial C++ port of TagSoup.</p></li>

","<p>As everyone suggested already, the weird colors you're observing are overflow. And as you point out in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/524930/numpy-pil-adding-an-image/524943#524943"">comment of schnaader's answer</a> you <strong>still get overflow</strong> if you add your images like this:</p>

<pre><code>addition=(im1arr+im2arr)/2
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this overflow is that your NumPy arrays (<em>im1arr</em>  <em>im2arr</em>) are of the <strong>uint8</strong> type (i.e. 8-bit). This means each element of the array can only hold values up to 255, so when your sum exceeds 255, it loops back around 0:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;array([255,10,100],dtype='uint8') +  array([1,10,160],dtype='uint8')
array([ 0, 20,  4], dtype=uint8)
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid overflow, your arrays should be able to contain values beyond 255. You need to <strong>convert them to floats</strong> for instance, perform the blending operation and <strong>convert the result back to uint8</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>im1arrF = im1arr.astype('float')
im2arrF = im2arr.astype('float')
additionF = (im1arrF+im2arrF)/2
addition = additionF.astype('uint8')
</code></pre>

<p>You <strong>should not</strong> do this:</p>

<pre><code>addition = im1arr/2 + im2arr/2
</code></pre>

<p>as you lose information, by squashing the dynamic of the image (you effectively make the images 7-bit) before you perform the blending information.</p>

<p><strong>MATLAB note</strong>: the reason you don't see this problem in MATLAB, is probably because MATLAB takes care of the overflow implicitly in one of its functions.</p>

<a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/operator.html"">http://docs.python.org/library/operator.html</a></p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operator module exports a set of
  functions implemented in C
  corresponding to the intrinsic
  operators of Python. For example,
  operator.add(x, y) is equivalent to
  the expression x+y. The function names

<p>I'm not sure I understand the benefit or purpose of this module.</p>
","<p>Possibly the most popular usage is operator.itemgetter.  Given a list <code>lst</code> of tuples, you can sort by the ith element by: <code>lst.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(i))</code></p>

<p>Certainly, you could do the same thing without operator by defining your own key function, but the operator module makes it slightly neater.</p>

<p>As to the rest, python allows a functional style of programming, and so it can come up -- for instance, Greg's reduce example.</p>

<p>You might argue: ""Why do I need <code>operator.add</code> when I can just do: <code>add = lambda x, y: x+y</code>?"" The answers are:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>operator.add</code> is (I think) slightly faster.</li>
<li>It makes the code easier to understand for you, or another person later, looking at it.  They don't need to look for the definition of add, because they know what the operator module does.</li>

","<p>Your sample images are not showing up form me so I am going to do a bit of guessing.</p>

<p>I can't remember exactly how the numpy to pil conversion works but there are two likely cases. I am 95% sure it is 1 but am giving 2 just in case I am wrong.
 1) 1 im1Arr is a MxN array of integers (ARGB) and when you add im1arr and im2arr together you are overflowing from one channel into the next if the components b1+b2>255. I am guessing matlab represents their images as MxNx3 arrays so each color channel is separate. You can solve this by splitting the PIL image channels and then making numpy arrays</p>

<p>2) 1 im1Arr is a MxNx3 array of bytes and when you add im1arr and im2arr together you are wrapping the component around.  </p>

<p>You are also going to have to rescale the range back to between 0-255 before displaying. Your choices are divide by 2, scale by 255/array.max() or do a clip. I don't know what matlab does</p>

<p>I'm not just using now() or localtime() as that would use the server's timezone, not the user's timezone.</p>

<p>I can't help feeling I'm missing something, any ideas?</p>
","<p>I think you can shave off a few method calls if you do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.now(pytz.timezone(""Australia/Melbourne"")) \
            .replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) \
            .astimezone(pytz.utc)
</code></pre>

<p>BUTâ¦ there is a bigger problem than aesthetics in your code: it will give the wrong result on the day of the switch to or from Daylight Saving Time.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that neither the datetime constructors nor <code>replace()</code> take DST changes into account.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; now = datetime(2012, 4, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(""Australia/Melbourne""))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print now
2012-04-01 05:00:00+10:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print now.replace(hour=0)
2012-04-01 00:00:00+10:00 # wrong! midnight was at 2012-04-01 00:00:00+11:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print datetime(2012, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=tz)
2012-03-01 00:00:00+10:00 # wrong again!
</code></pre>

<p>However, the documentation for <code>tz.localize()</code> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method should be used to construct localtimes, rather
  than passing a tzinfo argument to a datetime constructor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, your problem is solved like so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pytz
&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime, date, time

&gt;&gt;&gt; tz = pytz.timezone(""Australia/Melbourne"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; the_date = date(2012, 4, 1) # use date.today() here

&gt;&gt;&gt; midnight_without_tzinfo = datetime.combine(the_date, time())
&gt;&gt;&gt; print midnight_without_tzinfo
2012-04-01 00:00:00

&gt;&gt;&gt; midnight_with_tzinfo = tz.localize(midnight_without_tzinfo)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print midnight_with_tzinfo
2012-04-01 00:00:00+11:00

&gt;&gt;&gt; print midnight_with_tzinfo.astimezone(pytz.utc)
2012-03-31 13:00:00+00:00
</code></pre>

","<p>Each time zone has a number, eg US/Central = -6. This is defined as the offset in hours from UTC. Since 0000 is midnight, you can simply use this offset to find the time in any time zone when it is midnight UTC. To access that, I believe you can use <pre> time.timezone</pre></p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Python Docs</a>, time.timezone actually gives the negative value of this number:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>time.timezone</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in the UK).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So you would simply use that number for the time in hours if it's positive (i.e., if it's midnight in Chicago (which has a +6 timezone value), then it's 6000 = 6am UTC).</p>

<p>If the number is negative, subtract from 24. For example, Berlin would give -1, so 24 - 1 => 2300 = 11pm.</p>

","<p>Recall that ""unit testing"" is only one kind of testing.  You should be able to unit test the <strong>internal</strong> pieces of your code generator.  What you're really looking at here is system level testing (a.k.a. regression testing).  It's not just semantics... there are different mindsets, approaches, expectations, etc.  It's certainly more work, but you probably need to bite the bullet and set up an end-to-end regression test suite: fixed C++ files -> SWIG interfaces -> python modules -> known output.  You really want to check the known input (fixed C++ code) against expected output (what comes out of the final Python program).  Checking the code generator results directly would be like diffing object files...</p>

<p>How could I make the classes from the jython jar ""see"" the modules python has available?</p>
","<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.jython.org/Project/userfaq.html#jython-modules"" rel=""nofollow"">FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>4.1   What parts of the Python library are supported?</h2>
  
  <p>The good news is that Jython now supports a large majority of the standard Python library. The bad news is that this has moved so rapidly, it's hard to keep the documentation up to date.</p>
  
  <p>Built-in modules (e.g. those that are written in C for CPython) are a different story. These would have to be ported to Java, or implemented with a JNI bridge in order to be used by Jython. Some built-in modules have been ported to JPython, most notably cStringIO, cPickle, struct, and binascii. It is unlikely that JNI modules will be included in Jython proper though.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to use a standard Python module, just try importing it. If that works, you're probably all set. You can also do a dir() on the modules to check the list of functions it implements.</p>
  
  <p>If there is some standard Python module that you have a real need for that doesn't work with Jython yet, please send us mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you <em>can</em> directly use Python modules from Jython, unless you're trying to use built-in modules, in which case you're stuck with whatever has been ported to Jython.</p>

0,11060,8,18,python,How should I unit test a code-generator?,"<p>This is a difficult and open-ended question I know, but I thought I'd throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions.</p>

<p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p>

<p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p>

<p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p>

<p>Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share?</p>
","<p>I started writing up a summary of my experience with my own code generator, then went back and re-read your question and found you had already touched upon the same issues yourself, focus on the execution results instead of the code layout/look.</p>

<p>Problem is, this is hard to test, the generated code might not be suited to actually run in the environment of the unit test system, and how do you encode the expected results?</p>

<p>I've found that you need to break down the code generator into smaller pieces and unit test those. Unit testing a full code generator is more like integration testing than unit testing if you ask me.</p>

<p>What is the best way to convert the entire file format using Python?</p>
","<p>You can convert the file easily enough just using the <code>unicode</code> function, but you'll run into problems with Unicode characters without a straight ASCII equivalent.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.peterbe.com/plog/unicode-to-ascii"">This blog</a> recommends the <code><a href=""http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-unicodedata.html"">unicodedata </a></code> module, which seems to take care of roughly converting characters without direct corresponding ASCII values, e.g.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>is typically converted to </p>

<pre><code>Klft skrms infr p fdral lectoral groe

<p>which is pretty wrong. However, using the <code>unicodedata</code> module, the result can be much closer to the original text:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import unicodedata
&gt;&gt;&gt; unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', title).encode('ascii','ignore')
'Kluft skrams infor pa federal electoral groe'

<p>What is the best way to convert the entire file format using Python?</p>
","<p>Here's some simple (and stupid) code to do encoding translation.  I'm assuming (but you shouldn't) that the input file is in UTF-16 (Windows calls this simply 'Unicode').</p>

<pre><code>input_codec = 'UTF-16'
output_codec = 'ASCII'

unicode_file = open('filename')
unicode_data = unicode_file.read().decode(input_codec)
ascii_file = open('new filename', 'w')
ascii_file.write(unicode_data.write(unicode_data.encode(output_codec)))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will not work if there are any characters in the Unicode file that are not also ASCII characters.  You can do the following to turn unrecognized characters into '?'s:</p>

<pre><code>ascii_file.write(unicode_data.write(unicode_data.encode(output_codec, 'replace')))
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to convert the entire file format using Python?</p>
","<p>It's important to note that there is no 'Unicode' file format.  Unicode can be encoded to bytes in several different ways.  Most commonly UTF-8 or UTF-16.  You'll need to know which one your 3rd-party tool is outputting.  Once you know that, converting between different encodings is pretty easy:</p>

<pre><code>in_file = open(""myfile.txt"", ""rb"")
out_file = open(""mynewfile.txt"", ""wb"")

in_byte_string = in_file.read()
unicode_string = bytestring.decode('UTF-16')
out_byte_string = unicode_string.encode('ASCII')

out_file.write(out_byte_string)
out_file.close()
</code></pre>

<p>As noted in the other replies, you're probably going to want to supply an error handler to the encode method.  Using 'replace' as the error handler is simple, but will mangle your text if it contains characters that cannot be represented in ASCII.</p>

","<p><em>I think this is a deeper issue than you realize</em>. Simply changing the file from Unicode into ASCII is easy, however, getting all of the Unicode characters to translate into reasonable ASCII counterparts (many letters are not available in both encodings) is another.</p>

<p>This Python Unicode tutorial may give you a better idea of what happens to Unicode strings that are translated to ASCII: <a href=""http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Here's a useful quote from the site:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python 1.6 also gets a ""unicode""
  built-in function, to which you can
  specify the encoding:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello') u'hello'
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello', 'ascii') u'hello'
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('hello', 'iso-8859-1') u'hello'
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>All three of these return the same
  thing, since the characters in 'Hello'
  are common to all three encodings.</p>
  
  <p>Now let's encode something with a
  European accent, which is outside of
  ASCII. What you see at a console may
  depend on your operating system
  locale; Windows lets me type in
  ISO-Latin-1.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a = unicode('AndrÃ©','latin-1')
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a u'Andr\202'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can't type an acute letter e,
  you can enter the string 'Andr\202',
  which is unambiguous.</p>
  
  <p>Unicode supports all the common
  operations such as iteration and
  splitting. We won't run over them
  here.</p>

        alert('hello world');
    };
    var s = 'bar';
    window[s](); // this won't work

<p>In this case, s is 'bar', but the function 'bar' only exists inside the scope of the function 'foo'.  It is not defined in the window scope.</p>

","<p>Python threads are good for <strong>concurrent I/O programming</strong>. Threads are swapped out of the CPU as soon as they block waiting for input from file, network, etc. This allows other Python threads to use the CPU while others wait. This would allow you to write a multi-threaded web server or web crawler, for example.</p>

<p>However, Python threads are serialized by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock"">GIL</a> when they enter interpreter core. This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.</p>

<p>There are solutions like running multiple Python interpreters concurrently, using a C based threading library. This is not for the faint of heart and the benefits might not be worth the trouble. Let's hope for an all Python solution in a future release.</p>

","<p>You can make it run slightly faster by avoiding the while loops in favor of setting low to 10 ** (len(str(x)) / n) and high to low * 10.  Probably better is to replace the len(str(x)) with the bitwise length and using a bit shift.  Based on my tests, I estimate a 5% speedup from the first and a 25% speedup from the second.  If the ints are big enough, this might matter (and the speedups may vary).  Don't trust my code without testing it carefully.  I did some basic testing but may have missed an edge case.  Also, these speedups vary with the number chosen.</p>

","<p>Well, if you're not particularly worried about precision, you could convert it to a sting, chop off some digits, use the exponent function, and then multiply the result by the root of how much you chopped off.</p>

<p>E.g. 32123 is about equal to 32 * 1000, the cubic root is about equak to cubic root of 32 * cubic root of 1000.  The latter can be calculated by dividing the number of 0s by 3.</p>

<p>This avoids the need for the use of extension modules.</p>

","<p>The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) might be a problem, but the API is quite OK. Try out the excellent <code>processing</code> module, which implements the Threading API for separate processes. I am using that right now (albeit on OS X, have yet to do some testing on Windows) and am really impressed. The Queue class is really saving my bacon in terms of managing complexity!</p>

16,34020,13,17,python,Are Python threads buggy?,"<p>A reliable coder friend told me that Python's current multi-threading implementation is seriously buggy - enough to avoid using altogether.  What can said about this rumor?</p>
","<p>The standard implementation of Python (generally known as CPython as it is written in C) uses OS threads, but since there is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock"" rel=""nofollow"">Global Interpreter Lock</a>, only one thread at a time is allowed to run Python code.  But within those limitations, the threading libraries are robust and widely used.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to use multiple CPU cores, there are a few options.  One is to use multiple python interpreters concurrently, as mentioned by others.  Another option is to use a different implementation of Python that does not use a GIL.  The two main options are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython"" rel=""nofollow"">Jython</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython"" rel=""nofollow"">IronPython</a>.</p>

<p>Jython is written in Java, and is now fairly mature, though some incompatibilities remain.  For example, the web framework <a href=""http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/2008/01/django-on-jython-minding-gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Django does not run perfectly yet</a>, but is getting closer all the time.  Jython is <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-December/116555.html"" rel=""nofollow"">great for thread safety</a>, comes out <a href=""http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/dwatkins/entry/benchmarking_parallel_python_1_2/"" rel=""nofollow"">better in benchmarks</a> and has a <a href=""http://cgwalters.livejournal.com/17956.html"" rel=""nofollow"">cheeky message for those wanting the GIL</a>.</p>

<p>IronPython uses the .NET framework and is written in C#.  Compatibility is reaching the stage where <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/03/django-and-ironpython"" rel=""nofollow"">Django can run on IronPython</a> (at least as a demo) and there are <a href=""http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/threading.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">guides to using threads in IronPython</a>.</p>

36,39960,0,17,python,javascript locals()?,"<p>In python one can get a dictionary of all local and global variables in the current scope with the built-in functions locals() and globals().

var bar = function(){ alert('bar'); };

var s = 'foo';
locals()[s](); // alerts 'foo'

108,79850,18,17,python,How do you design data models for Bigtable/Datastore (GAE)?,"<p>Since the Google App Engine Datastore is based on <a href=""http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html"">Bigtable</a> and we know that's not a relational database, how do you design a <strong><em>database schema</em>/*data model*</strong> for applications that use this type of database system?</p>
","<p>Designing a bigtable schema is an open process, and basically requires you to think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used</li>
<li>The relationships between your types</li>
<li>What indices you are going to need</li>
<li>The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)</li>
</ul>

<p>GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.</p>

<p>If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.</p>

<p>With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like ""Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N."" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of "" AND comment_id > last_comment_id"".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.</p>

<p>Reading over this answer, I find it a little vague. Maybe a hands-on design question would help to scope this down? :-)</p>

911,452610,11,16,python,How do I create a list of Python lambdas (in a list comprehension/for loop)?,"<p>I want to create a list of lambda objects from a list of constants in Python; for instance:</p>

<pre><code>listOfNumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
square = lambda x: x * x
listOfLambdas = [lambda: square(i) for i in listOfNumbers]
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a list of lambda objects, however, when I run them:</p>

<pre><code>for f in listOfLambdas:
    print f(),
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect that it would print</p>

<pre><code>1 4 9 16 25
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, it prints:</p>

<pre><code>25 25 25 25 25
</code></pre>

<p>It seems as though the lambdas have all been given the wrong parameter. Have I done something wrong, and is there a way to fix it? I'm in Python 2.4 I think.</p>

<p>EDIT: a bit more of trying things and such came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>listOfLambdas = []
for num in listOfNumbers:
    action = lambda: square(num)
    listOfLambdas.append(action)
    print action()

<p>Prints the expected squares from 1 to 25, but then using the earlier print statement:</p>

<pre><code>for f in listOfLambdas:
    print f(),
</code></pre>

<p>still gives me all <code>25</code>s. How did the existing lambda objects change between those two print calls?</p>

<p>Related question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/139819/why-results-of-map-and-list-comprehension-are-different"">Why results of map() and list comprehension are different?</a></p>
","<p>I'm guessing that the lambda you're creating in the list comprehension is bound to the variable i which eventually ends up at 5. Thus, when you evaluate the lambdas after the fact, they're all bound to 5 and end up calculating 25. The same thing is happening with num in your second example. When you evaluate the lambda inside the loop it's num hasn't changed so you get the right value. After the loop, num is 5...</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what you're going for, so I'm not sure how to suggest a solution. How about this?</p>

<pre><code>def square(x): return lambda : x*x
listOfLambdas = [square(i) for i in [1,2,3,4,5]]
for f in listOfLambdas: print f()
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the expected output:</p>

<pre><code>1
4
9
16
25
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to think of this is that a lambda ""captures"" its lexical environment at the point where it is created. So, if you give it <strong>num</strong> it doesn't actually resolve that value until its invoked. This is both confusing and powerful.</p>

","<p>You process each form as you normally would, ensuring that you create instances which have the same prefixes as those used to generate the form initially.</p>

<pre><code>def some_view(request):

        'form1': form1,

<p>still gives me all <code>25</code>s. How did the existing lambda objects change between those two print calls?</p>

<p>Related question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/139819/why-results-of-map-and-list-comprehension-are-different"">Why results of map() and list comprehension are different?</a></p>
","<p>When function statements are executed they are bound to their (lexically) enclosing scope.</p>

<p>In your snippet, the lambdas are bound to the global scope, because <code>for</code> suites are not executed as an independently scoped unit in Python. At the end of the <code>for</code> loop, the <code>num</code> is bound in the enclosing scope. Demo:</p>

<pre><code>for num in range(1, 6):
    pass
assert num == 5 # num is now bound in the enclosing scope
</code></pre>

<p>So when you bind identifiers in the <code>for</code> loop you're actually manipulating the enclosing scope.</p>

<pre><code>for num in range(1, 6):
    spam = 12
assert num == 5 # num is now bound in the enclosing scope
assert spam == 12 # spam is also bound in the enclosing scope
</code></pre>

<p>Same deal for list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code>[num for num in range(1, 6)]
assert num == 5
</code></pre>

<p>Mind blowing, I know. Anywho, with our newfound knowledge, we can determine that the lambdas you are creating are referring to the (single) <code>num</code> identifier bound in the enclosing scope. That should make this make more sense:</p>

<pre><code>functions = []
for number in range(1, 6):
    def fun():
        return number
    functions.append(fun)
assert all(fun() == 5 for fun in functions)
assert all(fun() is number for fun in functions)
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the coolest part that demonstrates it even more:</p>

<pre><code># Same as above -- commented out for emphasis.
#functions = []
#for number in range(1, 6):
#    def fun():
#        return number
#    functions.append(fun)
#assert all(fun() == 5 for fun in functions)
#assert all(fun() is number for fun in functions)
number = 6 # Rebind 6 in the scope and see how it affects the results.
assert all(fun() == 6 for fun in functions)
</code></pre>

<p>So the solution to this, of course, is to make a new enclosing scope for each <code>number</code> you want to bind. In Python, you can create new enclosing scopes with modules, classes, and functions. It's common to use a function just to create new enclosing scope for another function.</p>

<p>In Python, a <em>closure</em> is a function that <strong>returns another function</strong>. Kind of like a function constructor. Check out <code>get_fun</code> in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>def get_fun(value):
    """""":return: A function that returns :param:`value`.""""""
    def fun(): # Bound to get_fun's scope
        return value
    return fun

functions = []
for number in range(1, 6):
    functions.append(get_fun(number))
assert [fun() for fun in functions] == range(1, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>get_fun</code> is a function, it gets to have its own internal scope. Every time you call <code>get_fun</code> with a value, a little table is created to keep track of bindings within it; i.e. it says, ""Within this scope, the <code>value</code> identifier points to the thing that was passed."" That scope goes away at the end of the function execution, unless there's a reason for it to hang around.</p>

<p>If you're returning a function from within a scope, that's a good reason for parts of the ""scope table"" to hang around -- that function you're returning could reference things from that scope table when you call it later on. For that reason, when <code>fun</code> is created within <code>get_fun</code> Python tells <code>fun</code> about <code>get_fun</code>'s scope table, which <code>fun</code> keeps handy for when it's needed.</p>

<p>You can read more about the details and technical terminology (which I softened a bit) in the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/executionmodel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python docs on the execution model</a>. You can also look at the parts of the enclosing scope that a function refers to with <code>print fun.__closure__</code>. In the above, we see the reference to the <code>value</code>, which happens to be an int:</p>

<pre><code># Same as before, commented out for emphasis.
#functions = []
#for number in range(1, 6):
#    functions.append(get_fun(number))
#assert [fun() for fun in functions] == range(1, 6)
print functions[0].__closure__
# Produces: (&lt;cell at 0x8dc30: int object at 0x1004188&gt;,)

<pre><code>User.objects.all().

","<p>Classes are ""first class"" objects in Python, meaning they can be passed around and manipulated just like all other objects.</p>

<p>Models are classes -- you can tell from the fact that you create new models using class statements:</p>

<pre><code>class Person(models.Model):
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=64)

class AnthropomorphicBear(models.Model):
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=64)

<p>Both the <code>Person</code> and <code>AnthropomorphicBear</code> identifiers are bound to Django classes, so you can pass them around. This can useful if you want to create helper functions that work at the model level (and share a common interface):</p>

<pre><code>def print_obj_by_last_name(model, last_name):
    model_name = model.__name__
    matches = model.objects.filter(last_name=last_name).all()

<p>So <code>print_obj_by_last_name</code> will work with either the <code>Person</code> or <code>AnthropomorphicBear</code> models. Just pass the model in like so:</p>

print_obj_by_last_name(model=AnthropomorphicBear, last_name='Fozzy')

<p>How thoroughly do you check the input values before beginning computation, and how do you do your checking? Do you throw some kind of proprietary exception if input is faulty (BadInputException defined in the same module, for example)? Do you just start your calculation and figure it will throw an exception at some point if bad data was passed in (""asd"" to factorial, for example)?</p>

<p>When the passed in value is supposed to be a container do you check not only the container but all the values inside it?</p>

<p>What about situations like factorial, where what's passed in might be convertible to an int (e.g. a float) but you might lose precision when doing so?</p>
","<p>I <code>assert</code> what's absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Important: What's <em>absolutely</em> essential.  Some people over-test things.</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(num):
    assert int(num)
    assert num &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't completely correct.  long is also a legal possibility.</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(num):
    assert type(num) in ( int, long )
    assert num &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>Is better, but still not perfect.  Many Python types (like rational numbers, or number-like objects) can also work in a good factorial function.  It's hard to assert that an object has basic integer-like properties without being too specific and eliminating future unthought-of classes from consideration.</p>

<p>I never define unique exceptions for individual functions.  I define a unique exception for a significant module or package.  Usually, however, just an <code>Error</code> class or something similar.  That way the application says <code>except somelibrary.Error,e:</code> which is about all you need to know.  Fine-grained exceptions get fussy and silly.</p>

<p>I've never done this, but I can see places where it might be necessary. </p>

<pre><code>assert all( type(i) in (int,long) for i in someList )

<p>Generally, however, the ordinary Python built-in type checks work fine. They find almost all of the exceptional situations that matter almost all the time.   When something isn't the right type, Python raises a TypeError that always points at the right line of code.</p>

<p>BTW.  I only add asserts at design time if I'm absolutely certain the function will be abused.  I sometimes add assertions later when I have a unit test that fails in an obscure way.</p>

<p>Would return an instance of the Foo class.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Note that the last line would be self() not self.  self would return the class itself, while self() returns an instance.</p>

<p>Are there libraries/hacks I can use in the meantime to capture the basic behavior? I have a hierarchy that mixes different objects. The canonical example of a corporation structure with an Employee class, subclasses for types of employees, and a manager_id (parent_id) would be a good approximation of the problem I am solving. </p>

<p>In my case, I would like to represent the idea that an employee can manage other employees while being managed by a different employee. There are not separate classes for Manager and Worker, which makes this hard to spread across tables. Sub-classes would represent types of employees-programmers, accountants, sales, etc and would be independent of who supervises who (OK, I guess it's no longer a typical corporation in some respect). </p>
","<p>There are currently two forms of inheritance in Django - MTI (model table inheritance) and ABC (abstract base classes).</p>

<p>I'm new to python.  It doesn't appear that averages are built into the standard python library, which strikes me as a little odd.  Maybe I'm not looking in the right place.</p>

<p>So, given the following code, how could I calculate the moving weighted average of IQ points for calendar dates?</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import date
days = [date(2008,1,1), date(2008,1,2), date(2008,1,7)]
IQ = [110, 105, 90]
</code></pre>

<p>(there's probably a better way to structure the data, any advice would be appreciated)</p>
","<p>My python is a little bit rusty (anyone can feel free to edit this code to make corrections, if I've messed up the syntax somehow), but here goes....</p>

<pre><code>def movingAverageExponential(values, alpha, epsilon = 0):

   if not 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1:
      raise ValueError(""out of range, alpha='%s'"" % alpha)

   if not 0 &lt;= epsilon &lt; alpha:
      raise ValueError(""out of range, epsilon='%s'"" % epsilon)

   result = [None] * len(values)

   for i in range(len(result)):
       currentWeight = 1.0

       numerator     = 0
       denominator   = 0
       for value in values[i::-1]:
           numerator     += value * currentWeight
           denominator   += currentWeight

           currentWeight *= alpha
           if currentWeight &lt; epsilon: 
              break

       result[i] = numerator / denominator

   return result
</code></pre>

<p>This function moves backward, from the end of the list to the beginning, calculating the exponential moving average for each value by working backward until the weight coefficient for an element is less than the given epsilon.</p>

<p>At the end of the function, it reverses the values before returning the list (so that they're in the correct order for the caller).</p>

<p>(SIDE NOTE: if I was using a language other than python, I'd create a full-size empty array first and then fill it backwards-order, so that I wouldn't have to reverse it at the end. But I don't think you can declare a big empty array in python. And in python lists, appending is much less expensive than prepending, which is why I built the list in reverse order. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)</p>

<p>The 'alpha' argument is the decay factor on each iteration. For example, if you used an alpha of 0.5, then today's moving average value would be composed of the following weighted values:</p>

<pre><code>today:        1.0
yesterday:    0.5
2 days ago:   0.25
3 days ago:   0.125
...etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you've got a huge array of values, the values from ten or fifteen days ago won't contribute very much to today's weighted average. The 'epsilon' argument lets you set a cutoff point, below which you will cease to care about old values (since their contribution to today's value will be insignificant).</p>

<p>You'd invoke the function something like this:</p>

<pre><code>result = movingAverageExponential(values, 0.75, 0.0001)

","<p>Whether you seperate or mix tests and modules is probably a matter of taste, although I would strongly advocate for keeping them apart (setup reasons, code stats etc).</p>

<p>When you're using nosetests, make sure that all directories with tests are real packages:</p>

<pre><code>src/
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleA.py

    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        test_moduleA.py
        test_moduleB.py
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can just run <code>nosetests</code> in the toplevel directory and all tests will be found. You need to make sure that <code>src/</code> is on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, however, otherwise all the tests will fail due to missing imports.</p>

","<p>I don't know about nosetests, but you can achieve that with the standard unittest module. You just need to create a <code>test_all.py</code> file under your root directory, then import all your test modules. In your case:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
import test_module1
import test_module2
import subpackage1
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    allsuites = unittest.TestSuite([test_module1.suite(), \
                                test_module2.suite(), \
                                subpackage1.test_moduleA.suite(), \
                                subpackage1.test_moduleB.suite()])
</code></pre>

<p>each module should provide the following function (example with a module with two unit tests: <code>Class1</code> and <code>Class2</code>):</p>

<pre><code>def suite():
    """""" This defines all the tests of a module""""""
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(Class1))
    suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(Class2))
    return suite

","<p>This is probably a hotly-contested topic, but I would suggest that you separate your tests out from your modules.  Set up something like this...</p>

<p>Use <code>setup.py</code> to install these into the system path (or you may be able to modify environment variables to avoid the need for an ""install"" step).</p>

<pre><code>foo/
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleA.py
        moduleB.py
</code></pre>

<p>Now any python script anywhere can access those modules, instead of depending on finding them in the local directory.  Put your tests all off to the side like this:</p>

<pre><code>tests/
    test_module1.py
    test_module2.py
    test_subpackage1_moduleA,py
    test_subpackage2_moduleB.py
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure about your <code>nosetests</code> command, but now that your tests are all in the same directory, it becomes much easier to write a wrapper script that simply imports all of the other tests in the same directory.  Or if that's not possible, you can at least get away with a simple <code>bash</code> loop that gets your test files one by one:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
cd tests/
for TEST_SCRIPT in test_*.py ; do
    nosetests -m $TEST_SCRIPT
done

<p>The problem is that OptionParser.error does a sys.exit(2), and so main() naturally relies on that.  But nose or unittest detects the (expected) sys.exit(2) and fails the test.</p>

<p>I can make the test pass by adding ""return 2"" under the parser.error() call in main() and removing the sys.exit() call from parser_error_mock(), but I find it distasteful to modify the code under test to allow a test to pass.  Is there a better solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/3002/df"">df</a>'s answer works, although the correct call is ""self.assertRaises(SystemExit, sut.main)"".</p>

<p>Which means the test passes whatever the number is in the sys.exit() in parser_error_mock(). Is there any way to test for the exit code?</p>

<p>BTW, the test is more robust if I add:</p>

    self.assertEquals(type(e), type(SystemExit()))

","<p>I have been fighting with printed (or PDF) output from Python for 8 years now and so far I came across the following approaches (in order of personal preference):</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <a href=""http://www.jaspersoft.com/JasperSoft_JasperReports.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=JasperReports&amp;utm_campaign=JasperReportsSearchjasperreports"">JasperReports</a> via <a href=""https://github.com/hudora/pyJasper"">pyJasper</a> (written by me) or <a href=""http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/2008/07/antville-18473/"">JasperServer</a>. You can use the WYSIWYG design tool <a href=""http://www.jaspersoft.com/JasperSoft_iReport.html"">iReport</a> to define your layout. Your Python code will contact the Java based Jasper engine via HTTP and make it render a PDF (pyJasper handles that). We use that for a few thousand pages a day.</li>
<li>Use plain text output. You can't get any faster. We use that for a few hundred pages per day.</li>
<li>Use XSLT-FO. You also have to call a Java based rendering engine like FOB. Might result in performance issues but can be mitigated by having a long running Java server process  - same approach than with Jasper. We use that for a few hundred pages per day but writing XSLT-FO documents made my head hurt. Not used for new code.</li>
<li>Generate <a href=""http://www.latex-project.org/"">LaTeX</a> source and use a latex software package to render to PDF. Getting LaTeX to look like <strong>you</strong> like is quite difficult. But as long as you go with the provided LaTeX styles, you are fine. Not used in production at my shop.</li>
<li>PDF generation with the <a href=""http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html"">ReportLab Toolkit</a>. Somewhat low level. Even more low level: <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFPDF/"">FPDF</a>. We use FPDF-Ruby for a few hundred pages a day. Took a lot of fiddeling to get the layout we wanted.</li>
<li>Directly generate Postscript. Strange but you nearly can't get more in terms of speed and control. We used that to generate contact sheets with a few hundred thousand Jpegs per day. Takes fiddling but is fun.</li>
<li>use <a href=""http://www.troff.org/"">troff</a>/groff to generate Postscript/PDF. Very low level bute nice to do simple, high volume things. Never used it thus in production.</li>

<pre><code>def serve_forever(self, poll_interval=0.5):

A function can either return a value, or it can raise an exception; it can't do both.

By putting a return statement in a finally clause, you have declared that you want to return a value, no matter what, regardless of exceptions.  If Python behaved as you are asking and raised the exception, it would be breaking the contract of the ""finally"" clause (because it would fail to return the value you told it to return).</p>

","<p>Yes, this is a good strategy for readable but unique filenames.</p>

<p><strong>One important change</strong>: You should replace <code>os.path.isfile</code> with <code>os.path.lexists</code>!  As it is written right now, if there is a directory named /foo/bar.baz, your program will try to overwrite that with the new file (which won't work)... since <code>isfile</code> only checks for files and not directories.  <code>lexists</code> checks for directories, symlinks, etc... basically if there's any reason that filename could not be created.</p>

","<p>I recently created a cyclic data structure to represent the eight cardinal and ordinal directions. Its useful for each direction to know its neighbors. For instance, Direction.North knows that Direction.NorthEast and Direction.NorthWest are its neighbors. </p>

<p>This is cyclic because each neighor knows its neighbors until it goes full swing around (the ""->"" represents clockwise):</p>

<p>North -> NorthEast -> East -> SouthEast -> South -> SouthWest -> West -> NorthWest -> North -> ...</p>

<p>Notice we came back to North.</p>

<p>That allows me to do stuff like this (in C#):</p>

<pre><code>public class Direction
{
    ...
    public IEnumerable&lt;Direction&gt; WithTwoNeighbors
    {
        get {
           yield return this;
           yield return this.CounterClockwise;
           yield return this.Clockwise;
        }
    }
}
...
public void TryToMove (Direction dir)
{
    dir = dir.WithTwoNeighbors.Where (d =&gt; CanMove (d)).First ()
    Move (dir);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html#csv.reader"">csv.reader</a> have things to cleanup in case of exception?</p>

<p>I'd go with:</p>

<pre><code>with open(""myfile.csv"") as f:
    for row in csv.reader(f):
        # process row
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to submit the patch to use <code>csv.reader</code> and <code>with</code> statement together.</p>

<pre><code>import contextlib
</code></pre>

<p>Help on function contextmanager in module <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/contextlib.html"">contextlib</a>:</p>

<pre><code>contextmanager(func)
    @contextmanager decorator.
</code></pre>

<p>Typical usage:</p>

<pre><code>    @contextmanager
    def some_generator(&lt;arguments&gt;):
        &lt;setup&gt;
        try:
            yield &lt;value&gt;
        finally:
            &lt;cleanup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes this:</p>

<pre><code>    with some_generator(&lt;arguments&gt;) as &lt;variable&gt;:
        &lt;body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>equivalent to this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;setup&gt;

807,405540,18,13,python,What is a cyclic data structure good for?,"<p>I was just reading through <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=1HxWGezDZcgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=learning%20python&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=cyclic&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">""Learning Python"" by Mark Lutz and came across this code sample</a>:</p>

<pre><code>
>>> L = ['grail']
>>> L.append(L)
>>> L
['grail', [...]]

</code></pre>

<p>It was identified as a cyclic data structure.</p>

<p>So I was wondering, and here is my question:</p>

<h2><strong>What is a 'cyclic data structure' used for in real life programming?</strong></h2>

<p>There seems to be a little confusion, which i think stems from the very brief code sample... here's a few more lines using the same object L</p>

<pre><code>
>>> L[0]
'grail'
>>> L[1][0]
'grail'
>>> L[1][1][0]
'grail'

</code></pre>
","<p>Lots of things.  Circular buffer, for example:  you have some collection of data with a front and a back, but an arbitrary number of nodes, and the ""next"" item from the last should take you back to the first.</p>

<p>Graph structures are often cyclic; acyclicity is a special case.  Consider, for example, a graph containing all the cities and roads in a traveling salesman problem.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Okay, here's a particular example for you.  I set up a collection of towns here in Colorado:</p>

<pre><code>V=[""Boulder"", ""Denver"", ""Colorado Springs"", ""Pueblo"", ""Limon""]
</code></pre>

<p>I then set up pairs of cities where there is a road connecting them.</p>

<pre><code>E=[[""Boulder"", ""Denver""],
   [""Denver"", ""Colorado Springs""],
   [""Colorado Springs"", ""Pueblo""],
   [""Denver"", ""Limon""],
   [""Colorado Springs"", ""Limon""]]
</code></pre>

<p>This has a bunch of cycles.  For example, you can drive from Colorado Springs, to Limon, to Denver, and back to Colorado Springs.</p>

<p>If you create a data structure that contains all the cities in V and all the roads in E, that's a <em>graph</em> data structure.  This graph would have cycles.</p>

1078,529890,10,13,python,Django - How to prepopulate admin form fields,"<p>I know that you can prepopulate admin form fields based on other fields. For example, I have a slug field that is automatically populated based on the title field.</p>

<p>However, I would also like to make other automatic prepopulations based on the date. For example, I have an URL field, and I want it to automatically be set to <a href=""http://example.com/20090209.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/20090209.mp3</a> where 20090209 is YYYYMMDD. </p>

<p>I would also like to have a text field that automatically starts with something like ""Hello my name is author"" where author is the current user's name. Of course, I also want the person to be able to edit the field. The point is to just make it so the user can fill out the admin form more easily, and not just to have fields that are completely automatic.</p>
","<p>Django's built-in prepopulated_fields functionality is hardcoded to slugify, it can't really be used for more general purposes.</p>

<p>You'll need to write your own Javascript function to do the prepopulating.  The best way to get it included in the admin page is to include it in the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/media/#topics-forms-media"">inner Media class</a> of a custom Form or <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/widgets/"">Widget</a>.  You'll then need to customize your <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-objects"">ModelAdmin subclass</a> to use the custom form or widget.  Last, you'll need to render some inline Javascript along with each prepopulated field to register the onchange handler and tell it which other field to populate from; I would render this via the custom Widget.  To make it nice and declarative you could use a custom ModelAdmin attribute (similar to prepopulated_fields), and override ModelAdmin.formfield_for_dbfield to create the widget and pass in the information about what field it should prepopulate from.</p>

<p>This kind of admin hacking is almost always possible, but (as you can tell from this convoluted summary) rarely simple, especially if you're making an effort to keep your code nicely encapsulated.</p>

To prevent duplicate filenames from being over-written, I wrote this little function - and I'm just wondering if there is a better way to do this?
Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>def unique_filename(file_name):
counter = 1
file_name_parts = os.path.splitext(file_name) # returns ('/path/file', '.ext')
while os.path.isfile(file_name): 
    file_name = file_name_parts[0] + '_' + str(counter) + file_name_parts[1]
    counter += 1
return file_name
</code></pre>

<p>I really <em>do</em> require the files to be in a single directory, and numbering duplicates is definitely acceptable in my case, so I'm not looking for a more robust method (tho' I suppose any pointers are welcome), but just to make sure that what this accomplishes is getting done the right way.</p>
","<p>One issue is that there is a race condition in your above code, since there is a gap between testing for existance, and creating the file.  There may be security implications to this (think about someone maliciously inserting a symlink to a sensitive file which they wouldn't be able to overwrite, but your program running with a higher privilege could)  Attacks like these are why things like os.tempnam() are deprecated.</p>

<p>To get around it, the best approach is to actually try create the file in such a way that you'll get an exception if it fails, and on success, return the actually opened file object.  This can be done with the lower level os.open functions, by passing both the os.O_CREAT and os.O_EXCL flags.  Once opened, return the actual file (and optionally filename) you create.  Eg, here's your code modified to use this approach (returning a (file, filename) tuple):</p>

<pre><code>def unique_file(file_name):
    counter = 1
    file_name_parts = os.path.splitext(file_name) # returns ('/path/file', '.ext')
    while 1:
        try:
            fd = os.open(file_name, os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL | os.O_RDRW)
            return os.fdopen(fd), file_name
        except OSError:
            pass
        file_name = file_name_parts[0] + '_' + str(counter) + file_name_parts[1]
        counter += 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong>  Actually, a better way, which will handle the above issues for you, is probably to use the tempfile module, though you may lose some control over the naming.  Here's an example of using it (keeping a similar interface):</p>

<pre><code>def unique_file(file_name):
    dirname, filename = os.path.split(file_name)
    prefix, suffix = os.path.splitext(filename)

    fd, filename = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix, prefix+""_"", dirname)
    return os.fdopen(fd), filename

&gt;&gt;&gt; f, filename=unique_file('/home/some_dir/foo.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print filename
/home/some_dir/foo_z8f_2Z.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The only downside with this approach is that you will always get a filename with some random characters in it, as there's no attempt to create an unmodified file (/home/some_dir/foo.txt) first.
You may also want to look at tempfile.TemporaryFile and NamedTemporaryFile, which will do the above and also automatically delete from disk when closed.</p>

I want to pass my function a list and pop items off it while retaining the original list. How do I make python ""instance"" the passed list rather that passing a pointer to the original one?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>def burninate(b):

","<p>As other answers have suggested, you can provide your function with a copy of the list.</p>

<p>As an alternative, your function could take a copy of the argument:</p>

<pre><code>def burninate(b):
    c = []
    b = list(b)
    for i in range(3):
        c.append(b.pop())
    return c
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, you need to be clear in your mind (and in your documentation) whether your function will change its arguments.  In my opinion, functions that return computed values should not change their arguments, and functions that change their arguments should not return anything.  See python's [].sort(), [].extend(), {}.update(), etc. for examples.  Obviously there are exceptions (like .pop()).</p>

<p>Also, depending on your particular case, you could rewrite the function to avoid using pop() or other functions that modify the argument.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def burninante(b):
    return b[:-4:-1]   # return the last three elements in reverse order

","<p>I've used Tkinter and wxPython.  Tkinter is quite basic, and doesn't use native widgets.  This means that Tkinter applications will look the same on any platform â this might sound appealing, but in practice, it means they look ugly on any platform :-/  Nevertheless, it's pretty easy to use.  I found <a href=""http://www.ferg.org/thinking_in_tkinter/index.html"">Thinking in Tkinter</a> very helpful when I was learning, because I'd never done any GUI programming before.  If things like frames and layout algorithms and buttons and bindings are familiar to you, though, you can skip that step.</p>

<p>You can augment Tkinter with Tix (but be warned, Tix doesn't play well with py2exe).  Also check out Python Megawidgets, which builds some more advanced controls using the Tkinter basics.</p>

<p>Finally, Tkinter plays nice with the shell: you can start the interpreter, do things like 'import tkinter' 'tk = tkinter.Tk()' etc. and build your GUI interactively (and it will be responsive).  (I think this doesn't work if you use IDLE, though)</p>

<p>wxPython is much better looking, and ships with a much greater range of controls.  It's cross-platform (though it seems a bit finicky on my Mac) and uses native controls on each platform.  It's a bit confusing, though.  It also ships with a demo application that shows off most of its features, and provides a test-bed for you to experiment.  Some specific thoughts on wxPython:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are three (?) different ways to lay widgets out.  Ignore two of them; just use Sizers.  And even then, you can do just about any layout using only BoxSizer and GridBagSizer.</li>
<li>All wx widgets have IDs.  You don't need to care what the IDs are, but in the old days (I think) you did need to know, so some old code will be littered with explicit ID assignments.  And most demo code will have -1 everywhere as the ID parameter (despite the fact that the methods all have ID as a keyword parameter that defaults to -1 anyway).</li>
<li>Make sure you get the standard wxWidgets docs as well as the wxPython Demo â you need them both.</li>
<li>If you want to use wxPython with py2exe and you want it to look good on Windows XP, you need a bit of trickery in your setup.py.  See <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2004-June/268126.html"">here</a></li>

  <p>EasyGUI is different from other GUIs in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven. It allows you to program in a traditional linear fashion, and to put up dialogs for simple input and output when you need to. If you have not yet learned the event-driven paradigm for GUI programming, EasyGUI will allow you to be productive with very basic tasks immediately. Later, if you wish to make the transition to an event-driven GUI paradigm, you can do so with a more powerful GUI package such as anygui, PythonCard, Tkinter, wxPython, etc.</p>

<p>Choice 1.  You could, BTW, build an ""installer"" that runs easy_install 6 times for them.</p>

<p>Choice 2.  You can save all of the installer kits that easy_install would have used.  Then you can provide a script that does an unzip and a <code>python setup.py install</code> for all six.</p>

<p>Choice 3.  You can provide a zipped version of your <code>site-packages</code>.  After they install Python, they unzip your site-packages directory into `C:\Python2.5\lib\site-packages``.</p>

<p>Choice 4.  You can build your own MSI installer kit for your Python environment.</p>

<p><strong>The situation</strong>: Developers want to hack on the source of this tool and then run it without having to build the binary. Currently this means that they need a python 2.6 interpreter (which is fine) and also have the 6 libraries installed locally using easy_install.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a public, classical open source environment: I'm inside a corporate network, the tool will never leave the ""walled garden"" and we have seriously inconvenient barriers to getting to the outside internet (NTLM authenticating proxies and/or machines without direct internet access).</li>
<li>I want the hurdles to starting to hack on this tool to be minimal: nobody should have to hunt for the right dependency in the right version, they should have to execute as little setup as possible. Optimally the prerequisites would be having a Python installation and just checking out the program from Subversion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Anecdote</strong>: The more self-contained the process is the easier it is to repeat it. I had my machine swapped out for a new one and went through the unpleasant process of having to reverse engineer the dependencies, reinstall distutils, hunting down the libraries online and getting them to install (see corporate internet restrictions above). </p>
","<p>I sometimes use the approach I describe below, for the exact same reason that @Boris states: I would prefer that the use of some code is as easy as a) svn checkout/update - b) go.</p>

<p>But for the record:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use virtualenv/easy_install most of the time.</li>
<li>I agree to a certain extent to the critisisms by @Ali A and @S.Lott</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, the approach I use depends on modifying sys.path, and works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Require python and setuptools (to enable loading code from eggs) on all computers that will use your software.</li>
<li>Organize your directory structure this:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
project/
    *.py
    scriptcustomize.py
    file.pth

    thirdparty/
        eggs/
            mako-vNNN.egg
            ... .egg
        code/
            elementtree\
                *.py
            ...
</pre>

<ul>
<li>In your top-level script(s) include the following code at the top:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
from scriptcustomize import apply_pth_files
apply_pth_files(__file__)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Add scriptcustomize.py to your project folder:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
import os
from glob import glob
import fileinput
import sys

def apply_pth_files(scriptfilename, at_beginning=False):
    """"""At the top of your script:
    from scriptcustomize import apply_pth_files
    apply_pth_files(__file__)

    """"""
    directory = os.path.dirname(scriptfilename)
    files = glob(os.path.join(directory, '*.pth'))
    if not files:
        return
    for line in fileinput.input(files):
        line = line.strip()
        if line and line[0] != '#':
            path = os.path.join(directory, line)
            if at_beginning:
                sys.path.insert(0, path)
            else:
                sys.path.append(path)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Add one or more *.pth file(s) to your project folder. On each line, put a reference to a directory with packages. For instance:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
# contents of *.pth file
thirdparty/code
thirdparty/eggs/mako-vNNN.egg
</pre>

<ul>
<li>I ""kind-of"" like this approach. What I like: it is similar to how *.pth files work, but for individual programs instead of your entire site-packages. What I do not like: having to add the two lines at the beginning of the top-level scripts.</li>
<li>Again: I use virtualenv most of the time. But I tend to use virtualenv for projects where I have tight control of the deployment scenario. In cases where I do not have tight control, I tend to use the approach I describe above. It makes it really easy to package a project as a zip and have the end user ""install"" it (by unzipping).</li>

","<p>As far as I know there is nothing out there that offers the sort of whiz-bang features that the Mono guys have implemented in their new shell, but that is not to say that the ""basic"" python interactive shell isn't a feature-complete and powerful application.  I could see something like the C# shell being developed at some point, but I think as of today those features you're pointing to are reasonably unique.  One might argue that this is because nobody thought of them or, alternatively, because nobody has really had a need for them.  I tend to subscribe to the latter, although I suppose both are plausible.</p>

<pre><code>appName = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().processName()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh, I think I know what you want. The name of the frontmost process, right?</p>

<p>I don't think there's a way to do it in Cocoa, but here's how to do it in Carbon in C:</p>

<pre><code>ProcessSerialNumber psn = { 0L, 0L };
OSStatus err = GetFrontProcess(&amp;psn);
/*error check*/

CFStringRef processName = NULL;
err = CopyProcessName(&amp;psn, &amp;processName);
/*error check*/
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to <code>CFRelease(processName)</code> when you're done with it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what that will look like in Python, or if it's even possible. Python doesn't have pointers, which makes that tricky.</p>

<p>I know PyObjC would translate the latter argument to <code>CopyProcessName</code> into <code>err, processName = CopyProcessName(â¦)</code>, but the Carbon bindings don't rely on PyObjC (they're part of core Python 2), and I'm not sure what you do about the PSN either way.</p>

","<p>Instead of posting a list of your options I will give my humble opinion:</p>

<p>I am in love with wxPython.</p>

<p>I have used Qt in C++ and Tk way back in the Tcl days but what really makes me like wxPython is the demo that you get with it. In the demo you can browse through all the different widgets frames etc that are part of the framework see the source code and actually see how it looks while it is running.</p>

<p>I had some problems getting the Linux version build and installed but now that I have it available I use it all the time. I have used wxPython for small data analysis applications and I have written several internal tools related to comparing test results, merging source code etc.</p>

","<p>I found this link a long time a go: <a href=""http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html</a>.  It suggests a tookit based on your criteria.  For me it suggests wxPython all the time.  Anyway it gives you a bunch of scores on the various toolkits.  What is right for me may not be right for you.  But it gives you how all the tookits scored according to your criteria, so if you don't like the top toolkit for some reason you can see which ones are closest to your criteria.</p>

<p>QT/GTK/WxWidgets (formerly wxWindows) seem to be among the most mature cross platform GUI toolkits.  The only issue is that none is installed with the default installation of Python, so you may have to compile the libraries.  If you want something with no installation required that just runs, then go with TKInter because as has been mentioned it is installed by default with Python.</p>

<p>Anyway my criteria were 9 on Ease of Use, 10 on maturity of documentation/widgets, 10 on installed base, 5 on gui code generators, 10 on native look and feel for both windows/linux and 1 and 5 for the last two, I'm not big into Mac OSX (even with a 10 here it suggests wxpython).</p>

Note on the difference between 4Suite writers and printers
Writer  - module that exposes a broad public API for building output
          bit by bit
Printer - module that simply takes a DOM and creates output from it
          as a whole, within one API invokation

<p>So, is there a way to force Python to use only 2 bytes for some integers (equivalent of C++ 'short')?</p>
","<p>Armin's suggestion of the array module is probably best.  Two possible alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can create an extension module yourself that provides the data structure that you're after.  If it's really just something like a collection of shorts, then
that's pretty simple to do.</li>
<li>You can
cheat and manipulate bits, so that
you're storing one number in the
lower half of the Python int, and
another one in the upper half. 
You'd write some utility functions
to convert to/from these within your
data structure.  Ugly, but it can be made to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's also worth realising that a Python integer object is not 4 bytes - there is additional overhead.  So if you have a really large number of shorts, then you can save more than two bytes per number by using a C short in some way (e.g. the array module).</p>

<p>I had to keep a large set of integers in memory a while ago, and a dictionary with integer keys and values was too large (I had 1GB available for the data structure IIRC).  I switched to using a IIBTree (from ZODB) and managed to fit it.  (The ints in a IIBTree are real C ints, not Python integers, and I hacked up an automatic switch to a IOBTree when the number was larger than 32 bits).</p>

","<p>If you're always pulling all available items off the queue, is there any real point in using a queue, rather than just a list with a lock?  ie:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement
import threading

    def __init__(self):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.items = []

</code></pre>

<p>If you're also pulling them individually, and making use of the blocking behaviour for empty queues, then you should use Queue, but your use case looks much simpler, and might be better served by the above approach.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit2]</strong>  I'd missed the fact that you're polling the queue from an idle loop, and from your update, I see that the problem isn't related to contention, so the below approach isn't really relevant to your problem.  I've left it in in case anyone finds a blocking variant of this useful:</p>

<p>For cases where you do want to block until you get at least one result, you can modify the above code to wait for data to become available through being signalled by the producer thread.  Eg.</p>

<pre><code>class ItemStore(object):
    def __init__(self):

<p>Example: I am testing a manager class that provides additional abstraction on top of Django persistent objects. The code looks more-less like that</p>

<pre><code>class TestForManager(unittest.TestCase):
  def testAddingBlah(self):
    manager = Manager()
    self.assertEquals(manager.getBlahs(), 0)
    manager.addBlah(...)
    self.assertEquals(manager.getBlahs(), 1)

  def testAddingBlahInDifferentWay(self):
    manager = Manager()
    self.assertEquals(manager.getBlahs(), 0)
    manager.addBlahInDifferentWay(...)
    self.assertEquals(manager.getBlahs(), 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the first assertion of second test fails, because the state of the database is preserved between test calls and there already is an instance of <code>Blah</code> in the database.</p>
","<p>As always, solution is trivial: use <code>django.test.TestCase</code> not <code>unittest.TestCase</code>. And it works in all major versions of Django!</p>

","<p>I did this once before in a Django server. There's two parts - client-side and server-side.</p>

<p>Client side you will have to send out XmlHttpRequests to the server as the user is typing, and then when the information comes back, display it. This part will require a decent amount of javascript, including some tricky parts like callbacks and keypress handlers.</p>

<p>Server side you will have to handle the XmlHttpRequests which will be something that contains what the user has typed so far. Like a url of</p>

<pre><code>www.yoursite.com/suggest?typed=www.sta
</code></pre>

<p>and then respond with the suggestions encoded in some way. (I'd recommend JSON-encoding the suggestions.) You also have to actually get the suggestions from your database, this could be just a simple SQL call or something else depending on your framework.</p>

","<p>The essence of your question is ""how come these class variables (which I assign Field objects to) suddenly become instance variables (which I assign data to) in Django's ORM""?  The answer to that is the magic of Python <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html"">metaclasses</a>.</p>

<p>A metaclass allows you to hook into and modify the process of creating a Python class (not the creation of an instance of that class, the creation of the class itself).</p>

<p>Django's Model object (and thus also your models, which are subclasses) has a <a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/db/models/base.py"">ModelBase metaclass</a>.  It looks through all the class attributes of your model, and any that are instances of a Field subclass it moves into a fields list.  That list is assigned as an attribute of the <code>_meta</code> object, which is a class attribute of the model.  Thus you can always get to the actual Field objects via <code>MyModel._meta.fields</code>, or <code>MyModel._meta.get_field('field_name')</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Model.__init__</code> method is then able to use the <code>_meta.fields</code> list to determine what instance attributes should be initialized when a model instance is created.</p>

","<p>Changing the index variable <code>i</code> from within the loop is unlikely to do what you expect. You may need to use a <code>while</code> loop instead, and control the incrementing of the loop variable yourself. Each time around the <code>for</code> loop, <code>i</code> is reassigned with the next value from <code>range()</code>. So something like:</p>

<pre><code>i = 2
while i &lt; n:
    if(something):

<p>In my example, the <a href=""http://python.org/doc/2.5/ref/continue.html""><code>continue</code></a> statement jumps back up to the top of the loop, skipping the <code>i += 1</code> statement for that iteration. Otherwise, <code>i</code> is incremented as you would expect (same as the <code>for</code> loop).</p>

53,51010,5,9,python,What is the simplest way to find the difference between 2 times in python?,"<p>I have 2 time values which have the type <code>datetime.time</code>. I want to find their difference. The obvious thing to do is t1 - t2, but this doesn't work. It works for objects of type <code>datetime.datetime</code> but not for <code>datetime.time</code>. So what is the best way to do this?</p>
","<p>You could transform both into <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/datetime-timedelta.html"" rel=""nofollow"">timedelta objects</a> and subtract these from each other, which will take care to of the carry-overs. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime as dt
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = dt.time(23, 5, 5, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = dt.time(10, 5, 5, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt1 = dt.timedelta(hours=t1.hour, minutes=t1.minute, seconds=t1.second, microseconds=t1.microsecond)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt2 = dt.timedelta(hours=t2.hour, minutes=t2.minute, seconds=t2.second, microseconds=t2.microsecond)
&gt;&gt;&gt;  print(dt1-dt2)
13:00:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dt2-dt1)
-1 day, 11:00:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(abs(dt2-dt1))
13:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>Negative timedelta objects in Python get a negative day field, with the other fields positive. You could check beforehand: comparison works on both time objects and timedelta objects:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dt2 &lt; dt1
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 &lt; t1
True
</code></pre>

<h2>['email.Encoders', 'email.Generator', 'email.Iterators', 'email.MIMEBase', 'email.MIMEMultipart', 'email.MIMEText', 'email.Utils', 'email.base64MIME']</h2>

<p>The executable does not work. The referenced modules are not included. I researched this on the Internet and I found out that py2exe has a problem with the Lazy import used in the standard lib email module. Unfortunately I have not succeeded in finding a workaround for this problem. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>P.S.
Imports in the script look like this:</p>

<p>Code: Select all
    import string,time,sys,os,smtplib
    from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
    from email.MIMEBase import MIMEBase
    from email.MIMEText import MIMEText

","<p>What version of Python are you using?  If you are using 2.5 or 2.6, then you should be doing your import like:</p>

from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email import Encoders

<p>I'm pretty certain that py2exe's modulefinder can correctly find the email package if you use it correctly (i.e. use the above names in Python 2.5+, or use the old names in Python 2.4-).  Certainly the SpamBayes setup script does not need to explicitly include the email package, and it includes the email modules without problem.</p>

<p>The other answers are correct in that if you do need to specifically include a module, you use the ""includes"" option, either via the command-line, or passing them in when you call setup.</p>

I want to do this programmatically as I need it to launch into full screen without any human interaction.</p>

<p>My guess is that I need to some how get a handle to the window and then send it an event that looks like the ""ctrl+f"" keystroke. </p>

<p>If it makes any difference, it looks like flashplayer is a gtk application and I have python with pygtk installed.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b> (the solution I used... thanks to ypnos' answer):</p>

<pre><code>./flashplayer http://example.com/example.swf &amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; ~/xsendkey -window ""Adobe Flash Player 10"" Control+F
</code></pre>
","<p>You can use a dedicated application which sends the keystroke to the window manager, which should then pass it to flash, if the window starts as being the active window on the screen. This is quite error prone, though, due to delays between starting flash and when the window will show up.</p>

<p>For example, your script could do something like this:
flashplayer *.swf
sleep 3 &amp;&amp; xsendkey Control+F</p>

<p>The application xsendkey can be found here: <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/adonovan/hacks/xsendkey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/adonovan/hacks/xsendkey.html</a>
Without given a specific window, it will send it to the root window, which is handled by your window manager. You could also try to figure out the Window id first, using xprop or something related to it.</p>

<p>Another option is a Window manager, which is able to remember your settings and automatically apply them. Fluxbos for example provides this feature. You could set fluxbox to make the Window decor-less and stretch it over the whole screen, if flashplayer supports being resized. This is also not-so-nice, as it would probably affect all the flashplayer windows you open ever.</p>

from collections import defaultdict

facts = SomeFact.objects.filter( dimension1__attribute=this, dimension2__attribute=that )
myAggregates = defaultdict( int )
for row in facts:
    myAggregates[row.dimension3__attribute] += row.someMeasure
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to create a two-dimensional summary, you have to do something like the following.</p>

<pre><code>facts = SomeFact.objects.filter( dimension1__attribute=this, dimension2__attribute=that )
myAggregates = defaultdict( int )
for row in facts:
    key = ( row.dimension3__attribute, row.dimension4__attribute )
    myAggregates[key] += row.someMeasure
</code></pre>

<p>To compute multiple SUM's and COUNT's and what-not, you have to do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>class MyAgg( object ):
    def __init__( self ):
        self.count = 0
        self.thisSum= 0
        self.thatSum= 0

myAggregates= defaultdict( MyAgg )
for row in facts:
    myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].count += 1
    myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].thisSum += row.this
    myAggregates[row.dimension3__attr].thatSum += row.that
</code></pre>

<p>This -- at first blush -- seems inefficient.  You're trolling through the fact table returning lots of rows which you are then aggregating in your application.</p>

<p>In some cases, this may be <em>faster</em> than the RDBMS's native sum/group_by.  Why?  You're using a simple mapping, not the more complex sort-based grouping operation that the RDBMS often has to use for this.  Yes, you're getting a lot of rows; but you're doing less to get them.</p>

<p>This has the disadvantage that it's not so declarative as we'd like.  It has the advantage that it's pure Django ORM.</p>

","<p>Use the <code>/g</code> modifier in your match. From the <code>perlop</code> manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""<code>/g</code>"" modifier specifies global pattern matching--that is, matching as many times as possible within the string.  How it behaves depends on the context.  In list context, it returns a list of the substrings matched by any capturing parentheses in the regular expression.  If there are no parentheses, it returns a list of all the matched strings, as if there were parentheses around the whole pattern.</p>
  
  <p>In scalar context, each execution of ""<code>m//g</code>"" finds the next match, returning true if it matches, and false if there is no further match.  The position after the last match can be read or set using the <code>pos()</code> function; see ""<code>pos</code>"" in <code>perlfunc</code>.   A failed match normally resets the search position to the beginning of the string, but you can avoid that by adding the ""<code>/c</code>"" modifier (e.g. ""<code>m//gc</code>"").  Modifying the target string also resets the search position.</p>

<p>Is this functionality simply broken or am I doing something wrong?  If the latter, what am I doing wrong?</p>
","<p>Well, it looks as if I will be answering my own question.</p>

<p>First, the documentation flat out lies where it reads ""In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation.""  In the current release, the ""splitlast"" and ""splitfirst"" row indices break with the aforementioned TypeErrors on the TEXTCOLOR and BACKGROUND commnds.</p>

<p>My suspicion, based on reading the source code, is that only the tablestyle line commands (GRID, BOX, LINEABOVE, and LINEBELOW) are currently compatible with the 'splitfirst' and 'splitlast' row indices.  I suspect that all cell commands break with the aforementioned TypeErrors.</p>

<p>However, I was able to do what I wanted by subclassing the Table class and overriding the onSplit method.  Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>class XTable(Table):
    def onSplit(self, T, byRow=1):
        T.setStyle(TableStyle([
          ('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 1), (1, 1), colors.black)]))
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is apply the text color black to the first and second cell of the second row of each page.  (The first row is a header, repeated by the repeatRows parameter of the Table.)  More precisely, it is doing this to the first and second cell of each frame, but since I am using the SimpleDocTemplate, frames and pages are identical.</p>

","<p>I am a fan of <a href=""http://pyglet.org"" rel=""nofollow"">pyglet</a> which is a completely self contained library for doing graphical work under win32, linux, and OS X. </p>

<p>It has very low overhead, and you can see this for yourself from the tutorial on the website. It <em>should</em> play well with wxpython, or at least I seem to recall posts to the mailing list about wxpython and pyglet being used together.</p>

<p>It however does not offer selection of objects via mouse clicks - this you will have to handle yourself. Generally speaking for a 2D application this is not too difficult to do.</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/freespace/mactorii"" rel=""nofollow"">mactorii</a> is an OS X application of mine written in pure python+pyglet, and has some basic animation (scrolling) and click detection. It doesn't use wxpython, but perhaps it will give you an idea of what is involved. Note however mactorii is using the old pyglet api, so the run loop I have in there is obsolete. I will get around to updating it one day... :P</p>

","<p>Well, thanks to all who answered the question. Anyway, I think I solved the mistery. </p>

<p>SELinux is completely disabled on the machine, so the problem is definitely in 'svn co' not being able to found config_dir for the user account it runs under.</p>

<p>Apache / mod_python doesn't read in shell environment of the user account which apache is running  on. Thus for examle no $HOME is seen by mod_python when apache 
is running under some  real user ( not nobody ) </p>

<p>Now 'svn co' has a flag --config-dir which points to configuration directory to read params from. By default it is $HOME/.subversion, i.e. it corresponds to the user account home directory. Apparently when no $HOME exists mod_python goes to root home dir ( /root) and tries to fiddle with .subversion content over there - which is obviously
fails miserably.</p>

<p>putting </p>

<p>SetEnv HOME /home/qa </p>

<p>into the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf doesn't solve the problem because of SetEnv having nothing to do with shell environment - it only sets apache related environment</p>

<p>Likewise PythonOption - sets only mod_python related variables which can be read with req.get_options()  after that</p>

<p>Running 'svn co --config-dir /home/ ...' definitely gives a workaround for running from within mod_python, but gets in the way of those who will try to run the script from command line.</p>

<p>So the proposed ( and working) solution is to set HOME environment variable prior to starting appache.</p>

<p>For example in /etc/init.d/httpd  script </p>

<pre><code>    QAHOME=/home/qa
    ...
    HOME=$QAHOME LANG=$HTTPD_LANG daemon $httpd $OPTIONS
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby was built from the ground up to be object-oriented. Even the literals are objects (evaluate 1.class and you get Fixnum). The language was built such that self is a reserved keyword that returns the current instance wherever you are.</p>

<ul>
<li>It allows me to serve (mostly) static pages with minimal URL configuration.</li>
<li>I don't have to write views for each of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I don't need the model <code>FlatPage</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>I leave the content empty and just supply a template path. Therefore I can take advantage of having the source in a file;
<ul>
<li>I can edit the source directly from the file system, without the help of a server (such as admin).</li>
<li>I can take advantage of syntax highlightning and other editor features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With the model I have to maintain fixtures for flatpages.
<ul>
<li>So the data for the same entity is in two seperate places.</li>
<li>If I move the content inside the fixture it'll be more difficult to edit.
<ul>
<li>Even if fixture maintenance was a non-issue I'd still need to dump and load these fixtures again and again during development.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>What I am looking for</h3>

<p>Basically; getting rid of <code>FlatPage</code> model while maintaining <code>contrib.flatpages</code> functionality. I don't have a clear idea how this should be solved. If there's a clean way of modifying (like <code>add_to_class</code>) <code>FlatPages</code> to get the information somewhere other than the database I'd prefer that. Maybe the metadata can be inserted to the templates and then a special manager that reads this data would replace the default manager of <code>FlatPages</code>.</p>

<p>If I don't prefer manual editing over admin functionality for flatpages, how can take the database out of the equation?</p>
","<p>Using the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/generic-views/#django-views-generic-simple-direct-to-template"" rel=""nofollow""><code>direct_to_template</code></a> generic view would be a lot simpler.  You could use the passed in parameters on one view to specify the actual template in urls.py, if you don't want to add an entry for each page:</p>

<pre><code>r'^foo/(?P&lt;template_name&gt;.+)/$','direct_to_template', {'template': 'foo_index.html'}),
</code></pre>

<p>Then import the template in your <code>foo_index.html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{% include template_name %}

","<p>Reading <a href=""http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html#spawn"" rel=""nofollow"">pexpect documentation for spawn</a>, I think it is waiting for the command to terminate.</p>

<p>I would suggest a couple of different possibilities, depending on your needs:</p>

<p>1) Kill the spawned process. However, this may lead to corruption in your operation, so I do not know if it is what you want.</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
child.close(True)
</code></pre>

<p>2) Wait for completion of the initial task before moving to the next one</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('command')
child.expect('password:')
child.sendline('the password')
child.wait()
child = pexpect.spawn('command2')
...
</code></pre>

<p>3) Use a different instance for all children, then wait on all of them at the end - and this would be most probably the best solution</p>

<pre><code>def exec_command(cmd):
  child = pexpect.spawn(cmd)
  child.expect('password:')
  child.sendline('the password')
  return child

commands = ['command1', 'command2']
childrens = [exec_command(cmd) for cmd in commands]
for child in childrens:
  child.wait()
</code></pre>

<p>Note: all of the code here is untested, and written under the assumption that your script is hanging because deleting a spawn object will hang until the command will terminate.</p>

","<p>I think the problem is, that SSH tries to open PTY and it does not work
on anything else than PTY for security reasons. This won't work well
with pexpect.</p>

<p>I have another ssh client:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.digmia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54:Digmia%20Enterprise%20SSH&amp;Itemid=56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digmia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54:Digmia%20Enterprise%20SSH&amp;Itemid=56</a></p>

<p>It's open-source, you can use it. What you are trying to do would
be more commands, but you don't need expect at all.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First install it accordingly to manual, then do something like this:</p></li>
<li><p>Run dssh-agent, add the password you need like this:</p>

<pre><code>dssh-add -l &lt; passwordfile
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>or if it is a secure machine, i.e. no one else can log in there,
this is <em>very</em> important, otherwise this would be a huge security hole:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""name-of-server;22;root;password;"" | dssh-add -l
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>password</code> file would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>name-of-server;22;root;password;
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>And the do something like (replace <code>CONTENTS OF ...</code> with actual content of that file):</p>

<pre><code>dssh root@name-of-server -- echo ""CONTENTS OF ~/.ssh/identity.pub"" &gt; .ssh/authorized_keys \; chmod og-w .ssh .ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>You can (optionally) do</p>

<pre><code>dssh-add -f passwords
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>(make sure no one else is doing all this stuff, otherwise you would
have a race condition).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, pexpect should probably work with dssh itself (so you don't need
to use dssh-agent). But using dssh-agent is simpler and safer.</p>

<p>Installation manual for DSSH is contained in the tarball.</p>

<p>I don't know any simpler way of doing this, OpenSSH ssh-copy-id is
very picky about where the password comes from...</p>

","<p>I wouldn't waste time and LOCs on checking for permissions. Ultimate test of file creation in Windows is the creation itself. Other factors may come into play (such as existing files (or worse, folders) with the same name, disk space, background processes.

897,450210,1,5,python,How to check if a file can be created inside given directory on MS XP/Vista?,"<p>I have a code that creates file(s) in user-specified directory. User can point to a directory in which he can't create files, but he can rename it.</p>

<p>I have created directory for test purposes, let's call it <code>C:\foo</code>.  </p>

<p>I have following permissions to <code>C:\foo</code>:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Traversing directory/Execute file  </li>
<li>Removing subfolders and files</li>
<li>Removing</li>
<li>Read permissions</li>
<li>Change permissions</li>
<li>Take ownership</li>

<p>I don't have any of the following permissions to <code>C:\foo</code>:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Full Control  </li>
<li>File creation  </li>
<li>Folder creation  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried following approaches, so far:</p>

<p><code><br />
os.access('C:\foo', os.W_OK) == True  </p>

<p>st = os.stat('C:\foo')<br />
mode = st[stat.ST_MODE]<br />
mode &amp; stat.S_IWRITE == True 
</code>  </p>

<p>I believe that this is caused by the fact that I can rename folder, so it is changeable for me. But it's content - not. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how can I write code that will check for a given directory if current user has permissions to create file in that directory?</p>

<p>In brief - I want to check if current user has <strong>File creation</strong> and <strong>Folder creation</strong> permissions for given folder name.</p>

<p>EDIT: The need for such code arisen from the Test case no 3 from 'Certified for Windows Vista' program, which states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The application must not allow the Least-Privileged user to save any files to Windows System directory in order to pass this test case.  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Should this be understood as 'Application may try to save file in Windows System directory, but shouldn't crash on failure?' or rather 'Application has to perform security checks before trying to save file?' </p>

<p>Should I stop bothering just because Windows Vista itself won't allow the Least-Privileged user to save any files in %WINDIR%? </p>

","<p>There is a library called <a href=""http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"">BeautifulSoup</a>, I think it's what you're looking for.
As you're trying to parse a invalid XML, the normal XML parser won't work. BeautifulSoup is more fail-tolerant, it can still extract information from invalid XML.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML
  parser designed for quick turnaround
  projects like screen-scraping. Three
  features make it powerful:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Beautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup. It yields a
  parse tree that makes approximately as
  much sense as your original document.
  This is usually good enough to collect
  the data you need and run away.</li>
  <li>Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for
  navigating, searching, and modifying a
  parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a
  document and extracting what you need.
  You don't have to create a custom
  parser for each application.</li>
  <li>Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode
  and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You
  don't have to think about encodings,
  unless the document doesn't specify an
  encoding and Beautiful Soup can't
  autodetect one. Then you just have to
  specify the original encoding. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Beautiful Soup parses anything you
  give it, and does the tree traversal
  stuff for you. You can tell it ""Find
  all the links"", or ""Find all the links
  of class externalLink"", or ""Find all
  the links whose urls match ""foo.com"",
  or ""Find the table heading that's got
  bold text, then give me that text.""</p>

<p>Why? Why this inconsistent behavior? Is it a bug? is it intended? Very awkward.</p>
","<p>The behaviour does seem confusing, but intensional. I reproduce here the entirety of the unicode documentation from the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python Built-In Functions documentation</a> (for version 2.5.2, as I write this):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>unicode([object[, encoding [, errors]]])</strong></p>
  
  <p>Return the Unicode string version of object using one of the following modes:</p>
  
  <p>If encoding and/or errors are given, unicode() will decode the
     object which can either be an 8-bit string or a character buffer
     using the codec for encoding. The encoding parameter is a string
     giving the name of an encoding; if the encoding is not known,
     LookupError is raised. Error handling is done according to
     errors; this specifies the treatment of characters which are
     invalid in the input encoding. If errors is 'strict' (the
     default), a ValueError is raised on errors, while a value of
     'ignore' causes errors to be silently ignored, and a value of
     'replace' causes the official Unicode replacement character,
     U+FFFD, to be used to replace input characters which cannot be
     decoded. See also the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/module-codecs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">codecs</a> module.</p>
  
  <p>If no optional parameters are given, unicode() will mimic the
     behaviour of str() except that it returns Unicode strings
     instead of 8-bit strings. More precisely, if object is a Unicode
     string or subclass it will return that Unicode string without
     any additional decoding applied.</p>
  
  <p>For objects which provide a __unicode__() method, it will call
     this method without arguments to create a Unicode string. For
     all other objects, the 8-bit string version or representation is
     requested and then converted to a Unicode string using the codec
     for the default encoding in 'strict' mode.</p>
  
  <p>New in version 2.0. Changed in version 2.2: Support for __unicode__() added. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, when you call <code>unicode(r, 'utf-8')</code>, it requires an 8-bit string or a character buffer as the first argument, so it coerces your object using the <code>__str__()</code> method, and attempts to decode that using the <code>utf-8</code> codec. Without the <code>utf-8</code>, the <code>unicode()</code> function looks for a for a <code>__unicode__()</code> method on your object, and not finding it, calls the <code>__str__()</code> method, as you suggested, attempting to use the default codec to convert to unicode.</p>

<p>Why? Why this inconsistent behavior? Is it a bug? is it intended? Very awkward.</p>
","<p><code>unicode</code> does not guess the encoding of your text. If your object can print itself as <code>unicode</code>, define the <code>__unicode__()</code> method that returns a Unicode string.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>The secret is that <code>unicode(r)</code> is not actually calling <code>__str__()</code> itself. Instead, it's looking for a <code>__unicode__()</code> method. The default implementation of <code>__unicode__()</code> will call <code>__str__()</code> and then attempt to decode it using the <code>ascii</code> charset. When you pass the encoding, <code>unicode()</code> expects the first object to be something that can be decoded -- that is, an instance of <code>basestring</code>.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behavior is weird because it tries to decode as ascii if I don't pass 'utf-8'. But if I pass 'utf-8' it gives a different error...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returns None.  The "".encode('utf-8')"" is a call to the encode function on what is returned by the above function.</p>

746,380420,10,5,python,How do I respond to mouse clicks on sprites in PyGame?,"<p>What is the canonical way of making your sprites respond to mouse clicks in PyGame ? </p>

<p>Here's something simple, in my event loop:</p>

<pre><code>for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        exit_game()
    [...]
    elif (  event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and
            pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0]):
        for sprite in sprites:
            sprite.mouse_click(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
</code></pre>

<p>Some questions about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this the best way of responding to mouse clicks ? </li>
<li>What if the mouse stays pressed on the sprite for some time ? How do I make a single event out of it ?</li>
<li>Is this a reasonable way to notify all my sprites of the click ?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","<p>I usually give my clickable objects a click function, like in your example. I put all of those objects in a list, for easy iteration when the click functions are to be called.</p>

<p>when checking for which mousebutton you press, use the button property of the event.</p>

<pre><code>import pygame
from pygame.locals import * #This lets you use pygame's constants directly.

for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:  #Better to seperate to a new if statement aswell, since there's more buttons that can be clicked and makes for cleaner code.
        if event.button == 1:
            for object in clickableObjectsList:
                object.clickCheck(event.pos)
</code></pre>

<p>I would say this is the recommended way of doing it. The click only registers once, so it wont tell your sprite if the user is ""dragging"" with a button. That can easily be done with a boolean that is set to true with the MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event, and false with the MOUSEBUTTONUP. The have ""draggable"" objects iterated for activating their functions... and so on.</p>

<p>However, if you don't want to use an event handler, you can let an update function check for input with:</p>

<pre><code>pygame.mouse.get_pos() 
pygame.mouse.get_pressed().
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bad idea for larger projects, since it can create hard to find bugs. Better just keeping events in one place. Smaller games, like simple arcade games might make more sense using the probing style though.</p>

","<p>Using application servers like Pylons, Django, etc. require much more work to setup and deploy then PHP applications which are generally supported out of the box.

I put forth the effort because coding in python is much more enjoyable to me than PHP and after you get the Apache config right once you never really have to mess with it again.

302,167120,11,5,python,Removing a subset of a dict from within a list,"<p>This is really only easy to explain with an example, so to remove the intersection of a list from within a dict I usually do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = {1:'', 2:'', 3:'', 4:''}
exclusion = [3, 4, 5]

# have to build up a new list or the iteration breaks
toRemove = []
for var in a.iterkeys():
    if var in exclusion:
        toRemove.append(var)

for var in toRemove:
    del a[var]
</code></pre>

<p>This might seem like an unusual example, but it's surprising the number of times I've had to do something like this. Doing this with sets would be much nicer, but I clearly want to retain the 'values' for the dict.</p>

The ones above are quite different in many ways, but any of these should offer you the best of both worlds if you want an app framework / appserver that runs on PHP. </p>

","<p>Python web-apps tend to require more initial setup and development than the equivalent PHP site (particularly so for small sites).  There also tend to be more reusable pieces for PHP (ie Wordpress as a blog).  Configuring a server to run Python web-apps can be a difficult process, and not always well documented.  PHP tends to be very easy to get running with Apache.</p>

<p>Also, as PHP is very widely used and is heavily used by beginners, there tends to be very good documentation for it.</p>

<p>However, Python is much more fun, and much more maintainable.  It scales well (in development complexity terms, rather than traffic).</p>

<p>Personally, I would also say that using Python tends to train you to solve problems in a better way.  I am definitely a better developer for having learned the Pythonic way of doing things.</p>

","<p>I have a feeling that some of the responses didn't address the initial question directly, so I decided to post my own. I understand that the question was about the difference between the <code>mod_php</code> deployment model and the application server deployment model.</p>

<p>In simple words, PHP executes a given script on every request, and the application has no knowledge of what has happened before (unless it is emulated somehow). Moreover even the source code is being parsed on every request (unless you use a bytecode cache like APC). This process can be slow, especially if you have a framework with complex initialization.</p>

<p>In contrast to this, the application server has to be started once, and then it waits for a request to be processed. The application server should clean up resources after every requests (allocated memory, open descriptors, etc.), it can also pool certain resources (like database connections) that can be reused between requests for extra performance.</p>

<p>This later model (application server) is more efficient in most cases, but on the other hand more difficult to setup and maintain. It is also more demanding, as you have to pay more attention to the resources you utilize, in order to avoid resource leaks.</p>

600,296270,2,4,python,Which is more efficient in Python: standard imports or contextual imports?,"<p>I apologize in advance if this question seems remedial.</p>

<p>Which would be considered more efficient in Python:</p>

<p><strong>Standard import</strong></p>

<pre><code>import logging

try:
  ...some code...
exception Exception, e:
  logging.error(e)
</code></pre>

<p>...or...</p>

<p><strong>Contextual import</strong></p>

<pre><code>try:
  ...some code...
exception Exception, e:
  import logging
  logging.error(e)
</code></pre>
","<p>They're essentially the same. The Python interpreter will only load a used module <em>once</em>, no matter how many times you import it. Changing the location of the import statement only has an effect on where the name is bound -- for example, if your <code>import</code> statement is inside a function, the name can only be used in that function.</p>

<p>Generally, though, imports are usually done as close to the ""top"" of a file as possible.</p>

","<p>I agree with S.Lott, that you should write out an example of what you want to generate.</p>

<p>Solving a problem with code generation should be less complicated than without.</p>

<p>This is because your total program has to deal with a lot of input information, and if a subset of that information changes very seldom, like once a week, the code generator only has to condition on that subset. The generated code conditions on the remaining input that changes more frequently.
It's a divide-and-conquer strategy. Another name for it is ""partial evaluation"".</p>

<p>Generated code should also run a lot faster because it's less general.</p>

<p>In your specific case, there's no harm in doing the code generation in 2 (or more) passes. Like on pass 1 you generate declarations. On pass 2 you generate process code. Alternatively you could generate two output streams, and concatenate them at the end.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. Sorry if I'm just saying what's obvious.</p>

<p>The problem is the following:</p>

<p>For our customer we have created (as part of a larger application) a
graphical designer which they can use to build ""scenario's"".</p>

<p>These scenario's consist of ""Composites"" which in turn consist
of ""Commands"". These command objects all derive from CommandBase and
implement an interface called ICompilable.</p>

<p>The scenario class also implements ICompilable. When Compile() is called
on a command an array of bytes is returned which can then be send to the device
for which they are intended (can't disclose to much info about that hardware, sorry)</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea:</p>

<pre><code>var scenario = new Scenario();

scenario.Add(new DelayCommand(1));
scenario.Add(new CountWithValueCommand(1,ActionEnum.Add,1));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));

scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new SkipIfCommand(1,OperatorEnum.SmallerThan,10));
scenario.Add(new JumpCommand(2));

byte[] compiledData = scenario.Compile();
</code></pre>

<p>The graphical designer abstracts all this from the user and allows
him (or her) to simply drag en drop composites onto the designer surface.
(Composites can group commands so we can provide building blocks for returning tasks)</p>

people writing their own language an parsers, etc...</p>

<p>If you only need really simple syntax then perhaps write your own language. Its actually not that hard to create a simple interpreter, as long as you have a strict, unambiguous language. Have a look for some examples of compilers in whatever youre using, c#?</p>

","<p>While it might be great fun to create this mini-language and code it all up, the real questions you need to ask are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the business case for adding this feature / facility?</li>
<li>Who is going to pay for this feature?</li>
<li>Who is going to ""sign off"" on this feature if you build it?</li>
</ol>

<p>""Really neat"" features have a way of getting built when the reality might indicate the true answer to such a request is ""no"".</p>

<p>See if you have a stakeholder willing to sponsor this before proceeding. Then check with the end users to see what they really want before committing to the project.</p>

<p>The problem is the following:</p>

on a command an array of bytes is returned which can then be send to the device

","<p>Here's a Pythonic solution for building a DSL that you can use to compile and create byte code arrays.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a simple module that makes your C# structures available to Python.  The goal is to define each C# class that users are allowed to work with (Composites or Commands or whatever) as a Python class.</p>

<p>Usually, this involves implementing a minimal set of methods with different conversions from C# types to native Python types and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Write some nice demos showing how to use these Python class definitions to create their scripts.  You should be able to create things like this in Python.</p>

<pre><code>import * from someInterfaceModule
scenario= Scenario(
    Delay(1),
    Repeat( Range(10),
        DirectPower( 23, False, 150),
        Wait(3),
        DirectPower( 23, False, 150)
    )
)
scenario.compile()
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>These are relatively simple classes to define.  Each class here be reasonably easy to implement as Python modules that directly call your base C# modules.</p>

<p>The syntax is pure Python with no additional parsing or lexical scanning required.</p>

<p>If you question is ""how do I handle all the special cases in my generating classes?"" then here's some advice.  If your question is something else, then update your question.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a template generator.  <a href=""http://www.makotemplates.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mako</a>, for example, will make your life simpler.</p>

<p>Write an example of your result.  Replace parts with <code>${thing}</code> placeholders.  Since you started with something that worked, turning it into a template is easy.</p></li>
<li><p>When generating code in another language, you need to have all of the class definitions in other other language designed for flexible assembly.  You want to generate as little fresh, new code as possible.  You want to tweak and customize a bit, but you don't want to generate a lot of stuff from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Special cases are best handled with ordinary polymorphism.  Separate subclasses of a common superclass can implement the various exceptions and special cases.  Really complex situations are handled well by the <strong>Strategy</strong> design pattern.  </p>

<p>In essence, you have Python classes that represent the real-world objects.  Those classes have attributes that can be fit into a C++ template to generate the C++ version of those objects. </p></li>

614,303360,1,4,python,Is there a better StringCollection editor for use in PropertyGrids?,"<p>I'm making heavy use of PropertySheets in my application framework's configuration editor.  I like them a lot because it's pretty easy to work with them (once you learn how) and make the editing bulletproof.</p>

<p>One of the things that I'm storing in my configuration are Python scripts.  It's possible to edit a Python script in a StringCollection editor, which is what I've been using, but there's a long distance between ""possible"" and ""useable.""  I'd like to have an editor that actually supported resizeable and monospace fonts, preserved blank lines, and - hey, let's go crazy with the wishlist - did syntax coloring.</p>

<p>I can certainly write this if I really have to, but I'd prefer not to.</p>

<p>I've poked around on the Google and can't find anything like what I'm describing, so I thought I'd ask here.  Is this a solved problem?  Has anyone out there already taken a crack at building a better editor?</p>
","<p>You would need to write your own type editor. You can think of this as a user control, in that when you write your own type editor you are providing the UI controls that appear when the property grid edits the property. As such, you can create a type editor that does anything, which means if you have a third-party editor control you can include it as part of type editor.</p>

662,347010,2,4,python,Questions for python->scheme conversion,"<p>I currently am trying to write a Python program using scheme semantics so I can later translate it into Scheme without relying on a lot of Pythonic stuff.</p>

<p>I'm trying solve the sliding puzzle problem (where you have 9 slots and 8 tiles arranged in a square) using a*, depth first, and breadth first search algorithm.  I did this ~11 years ago in some AI class in Lisp, but basically at the time I had no idea about lisp, I hated it with all my heart, and only in retrospect do I realize I was programming ""C"" in Lisp.  The prof didn't help in this matter.</p>

<p>I have a python function which can swap two tiles easily:  </p>

<pre><code>def swap(p, (r1, c1), (r2, c2)):  
    # Swaps *any* two locations and returns new configuration  
    # Does not concern itself with zero location, etc  
    # Not sure how to do this functionally  
    p_p = p[:]  
    temp = p_p[r1][c1]  
    p_p[r1][c1] = p_p[r2][c2]  
    p_p[r2][c2] = temp  
    return p_p  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to turn this into something you might find in SICP, avoiding side effects, etc.  </p>

<p>But this brings up a question.  Everything I read in SICP is loops via recursion.  I didn't see anything in accessing arrays/vectors/lists in constant time.  I can imagine a loopish/recursive way to read an element, but I find it harder to imagine a way to create a new list with a certain element changed, without invoking side-effect producing things like set!, and without resorting to crazy if/then/else clauses concerning which element should be changed.  This of course gets more confusing when considering a 2d array.  In this case the solution with python is obvious because of its native support for multidimensional arrays.</p>

<p>In C/C++/Python/Matlab/Lua/anything else, accessing lists/arrays via the [i] syntax is easy, and directly translates to a hardware-oriented pointer lookup somewhere underneath.  I don't understand how scheme does this, given the atomic operations defined in the SICP version of scheme, which all seem very loop-and-search oriented.  How do the vector and list array access functions work to get constant time access?  (I'm a total newbie here, so I'm not ever sure what functions I'd be talking about).  Is there a C or Assembly library someplace which is secretly being accessed?  Are there any inherent constant-time semantics in scheme which could be used for list/array/vector access, and which would allow me a guilt-free way of using that idiom in Python for the moment?  </p>

<p>How would can I rewrite the above function in python using Schemish semantics?  How would I rewrite the above function in Scheme?</p>
","<p>I wrote an 8-puzzle solver in Lisp about a year ago. I just used a list of 3 lists, each sublist with 3 elements being the numbers. It's not constant time, but it is portable.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you are really interested in doing this functionally (Scheme doesn't require you to) what is easiest to do is to create some helper functions that will get a specific value given row/col and 'set' a value given row/col. Instead of modifying the original data structure, the set operation will construct the new state based on the old state.</p>

<p>Then you can write a swap operation based on these get and set operations. Here's what I wrote about a year ago in Common Lisp, but it's easily convertible to Scheme:</p>

<pre><code>; getval
;
; This function takes a position (r . c) where and returns the corresponding
; number in the 8-puzzle state. For example, if you wanted (1 . 2) from
; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)), the value would be 6. The r and c values begin
; at 0.
;
; parameters:  pos    The position to get
;              state  The 8-puzzle state
; returns:     The value at pos in state
(defun getval (pos state)
  (if (null state) 'no-value
      (if (= 0 (car pos))
      (if (= 0 (cdr pos))
          (caar state)
          (getval (cons (car pos) (- (cdr pos) 1)) (list (cdar state))))
      (getval (cons (- (car pos) 1) (cdr pos)) (cdr state)))))

; setval
;
; This function returns a state where the value at pos is replaced by val.
; Like getval, this function is zero-based. Accessing beyond the size of
; the state is undefined (and probably broken)
;
; parameters:  pos    Position to set
;              val    Value to set
;              state  State to modify
; returns:     New state where pos is val
(defun setval (pos val state)
  (if (null state) '()
      (if (= 0 (car pos))
      (if (= 0 (cdr pos))
          (cons (cons val (cdar state)) (cdr state))
          (let ((temp (setval (cons (car pos) (- (cdr pos) 1)) val
    			  (cons (cdar state) (cdr state)))))
    	(cons (cons (caar state) (car temp)) (cdr temp))))
      (cons (car state) (setval (cons (- (car pos) 1) (cdr pos)) val (cdr state))))))

; state-swap
;
; This function takes a state and two positions and returns a new state with
; the values in those two positions swapped.
;
; parameters:  state  State to swap within
;              a      Position to swap with b
;              b      Position to swap with a
; return:      State with a swapped with b
(defun state-swap (state a b)
  (let ((olda (getval a state)) (oldb (getval b state)))
    (setval a oldb (setval b olda state))))

665,347010,1,4,python,Questions for python->scheme conversion,"<p>I currently am trying to write a Python program using scheme semantics so I can later translate it into Scheme without relying on a lot of Pythonic stuff.</p>

<p>I'm trying solve the sliding puzzle problem (where you have 9 slots and 8 tiles arranged in a square) using a*, depth first, and breadth first search algorithm.  I did this ~11 years ago in some AI class in Lisp, but basically at the time I had no idea about lisp, I hated it with all my heart, and only in retrospect do I realize I was programming ""C"" in Lisp.  The prof didn't help in this matter.</p>

<p>I have a python function which can swap two tiles easily:  </p>

<pre><code>def swap(p, (r1, c1), (r2, c2)):  
    # Swaps *any* two locations and returns new configuration  
    # Does not concern itself with zero location, etc  
    # Not sure how to do this functionally  
    p_p = p[:]  
    temp = p_p[r1][c1]  
    p_p[r1][c1] = p_p[r2][c2]  
    p_p[r2][c2] = temp  
    return p_p  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to turn this into something you might find in SICP, avoiding side effects, etc.  </p>

<p>But this brings up a question.  Everything I read in SICP is loops via recursion.  I didn't see anything in accessing arrays/vectors/lists in constant time.  I can imagine a loopish/recursive way to read an element, but I find it harder to imagine a way to create a new list with a certain element changed, without invoking side-effect producing things like set!, and without resorting to crazy if/then/else clauses concerning which element should be changed.  This of course gets more confusing when considering a 2d array.  In this case the solution with python is obvious because of its native support for multidimensional arrays.</p>

<p>In C/C++/Python/Matlab/Lua/anything else, accessing lists/arrays via the [i] syntax is easy, and directly translates to a hardware-oriented pointer lookup somewhere underneath.  I don't understand how scheme does this, given the atomic operations defined in the SICP version of scheme, which all seem very loop-and-search oriented.  How do the vector and list array access functions work to get constant time access?  (I'm a total newbie here, so I'm not ever sure what functions I'd be talking about).  Is there a C or Assembly library someplace which is secretly being accessed?  Are there any inherent constant-time semantics in scheme which could be used for list/array/vector access, and which would allow me a guilt-free way of using that idiom in Python for the moment?  </p>

<p>How would can I rewrite the above function in python using Schemish semantics?  How would I rewrite the above function in Scheme?</p>
","<p>Here's one way to achieve it.  Recreate the list using a function which will apply the appropriate mapping.</p>

<pre><code>def swap(p, (r1,c1), (r2,c2)):
    def getitem(r,c):
        if (r,c) == (r1,c1): return p[r2][c2]
        elif (r,c) == (r2,c2): return p[r1][c1]
        return p[r][c]
    return [ [getitem(r,c) for c in range(len(p[0]))] for r in range(len(p)) ]
</code></pre>

<p>You could even take this a step further and make the function be the actual interface, where each swap merely returns a function that does the appropriate conversions before passing through to the function below.  Not particularly performant, but a fairly simple functional approach that dispenses with nasty mutable datastructures:</p>

<pre><code>def swap(f, (r1,c1), (r2,c2)):
    def getitem(r,c):
        if (r,c) == (r1,c1): return f(r2,c2)
        elif (r,c) == (r2,c2): return f(r1,c1)
        return f(r,c)
   return getitem

l=[ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,0]]
f=lambda r,c: l[r][c]    # Initial accessor function
f=swap(f, (2,1), (2,2))  # 8 right
f=swap(f, (1,1), (2,1))  # 5 down
print [[f(x,y) for y in range(3)] for x in range(3)]
# Gives: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6], [7, 5, 8]]

","<p>I am somewhat new to Python as well, but from what I understand: </p>

<p>Although you can install multiple versions of the ""same"" egg (having the same name), only one of them will be available to any particular piece of code at runtime (based on your discovery method).  So if your egg is the one calling this code, it must have already been selected as <em>the</em> version of <code>my_project</code> for this code, and your access will be to your own version.</p>

","<p>Exactly. So you should only be able to get the information for the currently available egg (singular) of a library. If you have multiple eggs of the same library in your site-packages folder, check the easy-install.pth in the same folder to see which egg is really used :-)</p>

<p>On a site note: This is exactly the point of systems like zc.buildout which lets you define the exact version of a library that will be made available to you for example while developing an application or serving a web application. So you can for example use version 1.0 for one project and 1.2 for another. </p>

736,375620,0,4,python,Prevent ftplib from Downloading a File in Progress?,"<p>We have a ftp system setup to monitor/download from remote ftp servers that are not under our control. The script connects to the remote ftp, and grabs the file names of files on the server, we then check to see if its something that has already been downloaded. If it hasn't been downloaded then we download the file and add it to the list.</p>

<p>We recently ran into an issue, where someone on the remote ftp side, will copy in a massive single file(>1GB) then the script will wake up see a new file and begin downloading the file that is being copied in.</p>

<p>What is the best way to check this? I was thinking of grabbing the file size waiting a few seconds checking the file size again and see if it has increased, if it hasn't then we download it. But since time is of the concern, we can't wait a few seconds for every single file set and see if it's file size has increased. </p>

<p>What would be the best way to go about this, currently everything is done via pythons ftplib, how can we do this aside from using the aforementioned method.</p>

<p>Yet again let me reiterate this, we have 0 control over the remote ftp sites.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE1:</p>

<p>I was thinking what if i tried to rename it... since we have full permissions on the ftp, if the file upload is in progress would the rename command fail?</p>

<p>We don't have any real options here... do we?</p>

<p>UPDATE2:
Well here's something interesting some of the ftps we tested on appear to automatically allocate the space once the transfer starts.</p>

<p>E.g. If i transfer a 200mb file to the ftp server. While the transfer is active if i connect to the ftp server and do a size while the upload is happening. It shows 200mb for the size. Even though the file is only like 10% complete.</p>

<p>Permissions also seem to be randomly set the FTP Server that comes with IIS sets the permissions AFTER the file is finished copying. While some of the other older ftp servers set it as soon as you send the file.</p>

<p>:'(</p>
","<p>You can't know when the OS copy is done.  It could slow down or wait.</p>

<p>For absolute certainty, you really need two files.</p>

<ul>
<li>The massive file.</li>
<li>And a tiny trigger file.</li>
</ul>

<p>They can mess with the massive file all they want.  But when they touch the trigger file, you're downloading both.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>If you can't get a trigger, you have to balance the time required to poll vs. the time required to download.</p>

<p>Do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a listing.  Check timestamps.</p></li>
<li><p>Check sizes vs. previous size of file.  If size isn't even close, it's being copied right now.  Wait; loop on this step until size is close to previous size.</p></li>
<li><p>While you're not done:</p>

<p>a. Get the file.</p>

<p>b. Get a listing AGAIN.  Check the size of the new listing, previous listing and your file.  If they agree: you're done.  If they don't agree: file changed while you were downloading; you're not done.</p></li>

","<p>The traditional way would be to create and use a setuid helper to do whatever you need. Note that, however, properly writing a setuid helper is tricky (there are several attack vectors you have to protect against).</p>

<p>The modern way would be to use a daemon (running as root, started on boot) which listens to requests from the rest of the application. This way, your attack surface is mostly limited to whichever IPC you chose (I'd suggest d-bus, which seems to be the modern way).</p>

<p>Finally, if you are managing network interfaces, what you doing is very similar to what network-manager does on a modern distribution. It would be a good idea to either try to somehow integrate what you are doing with network-manager (so it will not conflict with your manipulations), or at least looks at how it works.</p>

","<p>I'm not familiar enough with Python to tell you what the necessary commands would be in that language, but you should be able to accomplish this by forking and using a pipe to communicate between the parent and child processes.  Something along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run the program as root via sudo or suid</li>
<li>On startup, the program immediately forks and establishes a pipe for communication between the parent and child processes</li>
<li>The child process retains root power, but just sits there waiting for input from the pipe</li>
<li>The parent process drops root (changes its uid back to that of the user running it), then displays the GUI, interacts with the user, and handles all operations which are available to a non-privileged user</li>
<li>When an operation is to be performed which requires root privileges, the (non-root) parent process sends a command down the pipe to the (root) child process which executes it and optionally reports back to the parent</li>
</ul>

<p>This is likely to be a bit easier to write than an independent daemon, as well as more convenient to run (since you don't need to worry about whether the daemon is running or not), while also allowing the GUI and other things which don't need root powers to be run as non-root.</p>

<p>The question is what can I do to separate memory leaks due to bugs in my code from memory leaks reported by valgrind as due to Guile.  Another tool instead of valgrind?  Special valgrind options?  Give up and rely upon manual code walkthrough?</p>
","<p>You've got a couple options. One is to write a supressions file for valgrind that turns off reporting of stuff that you're not working on. Python has such a file, for example: 
<a href=""http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/valgrind-python.supp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/valgrind-python.supp</a></p>

<p>If valgrind doesn't like your setup, another possibility is using <code>libmudflap</code>; you compile your program with <code>gcc -fmudflap -lmudflap</code>, and the resulting code is instrumented for pointer debugging. Described in the gcc docs, and here: <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging</a></p>

You might be able to set up an account that cannot login, use setuid to change your program's id (temporarily when needed) and have sudo set up to not prompt for password, but always allow access to that account for specific tasks.</p>

<p>This way your program has no special privileges when running normally, only elevates it's privileges when needed, and is restricted by sudo to only running certain programs.</p>

<p>It's been awhile since I've done much Unix development, so I'm not really sure whether it's possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a password (or even if there is an API for it), but  as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed.</p>

<p>[EDIT]  Looks like <a href=""http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/sudo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">sudo</a> has a NOPASSWD mode so I think it should work since you're running the programs as external commands.</p>

883,443920,1,3,python,"Why don't Django admin ""Today"" and ""Now"" buttons show up in Safari?","<p>I'm developing a Django application that contains a model with a date/time field. On my local copy of the application, the admin page for that particular model shows this for the date/time field:</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.cs.wm.edu/~mpd/images/bugs/django-date-local.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>This is as expected. However, when I deploy to my webserver and use the application from there, I get this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.cs.wm.edu/~mpd/images/bugs/django-date-server.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>The application on the server is <em>exactly</em> the same as my local copy, <em>except</em> that I have debugging disabled on the server (but I don't think that should matter...should it?). Why does the admin app on the server differ from the local admin app?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<ul>
<li>The issue seems localized to Safari. The ""Today"" and ""Now"" buttons appear when the admin site is accessed via Firefox. It looks like Safari can't download some of the JavaScript files necessary to show these widgets (strange that Firefox can, though).</li>
<li>I noticed that Safari is receiving a ""304 Not Modified"" code for the following files, but I'm not sure what that means, or how to fix it. Obviously, these are the JavaScript files and images that control the date/time widget:
<ul>
<li><code>RelatedObjectLookup.js</code></li>
<li><code>DateTimeShortcuts.js</code></li>
<li><code>icon_calendar.gif</code></li>
<li><code>icon_clock.gif</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
","<p>It seems like you have admin media missing (hence js and images aren't loading). I generally do following.</p>

<p>in <code>settings.py</code></p>

<pre><code>ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/media/admin/'
</code></pre>

<p>Then I symlink path of <code>django.contrib.admin.media</code> within my <code>media</code> dir. Say:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/django/contrib/admin/media/ /var/www/media/admin

<p>Development server serves admin media automatically. But on production servers one generally prefers to server static stuff directly from apache (or whatever server).</p>

1092,536370,1,3,python,Execute arbitrary python code remotely - can it be done?,"<p>I'm working on a grid system which has a number of very powerful computers. These can be used to execute python functions very quickly. My users have a number of python functions which take a long time to calculate on workstations, ideally they would like to be able to call some functions on a remote powerful server, but have it appear to be running locally.</p>

<p>Python has an old function called ""apply"" - it's mostly useless these days now that python supports the extended-call syntax (e.g. **arguments), however I need to implement something that works a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>rapply = Rapply( server_hostname ) # Set up a connection
result = rapply( fn, args, kwargs ) # Remotely call the function
assert result == fn( *args, **kwargs ) #Just as a test, verify that it has the expected value.
</code></pre>

<p>Rapply should be a class which can be used to remotely execute some arbitrary code (<code>fn</code> could be literally anything) on a remote server. It will send back the result which the <code>rapply</code> function will return. The ""result"" should have the same value as if I had called the function locally.</p>

<p>Now let's suppose that <code>fn</code> is a user-provided function I need some way of sending it over the wire to the execution server. If I could guarantee that fn was always something simple it could could just be a string containing python source code... but what if it were not so simple? </p>

<p>What if <code>fn</code> might have local dependencies: It could be a simple function which uses a class defined in a different module, is there a way of encapsulating <code>fn</code> and everything that <code>fn</code> requires which is not standard-library? An ideal solution would not require the users of this system to have much knowledge about python development. They simply want to write their function and call it.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I'm not interested in discussing what kind of network protocol might be used to implement the communication between the client &amp; server. My problem is how to encapsulate a function and its dependencies as a single object which can be serialized and remotely executed. </p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the use of these calls, but be aware that Python's signal handlers work differently than C. When Python code is attached to a signal callback, the signal is caught on the C side of the interpreter and queued. The interpreter is occasionally interrupted for internal housekeeping (and thread switching, etc). It is during that interrupt the Python handler for the signal will be called.</p>

<p>All that to say, just be aware that Python's signal handling is a little less asynchronous than normal C signal handlers.</p>

","<p>It's probably best to start off with the given <code>unittest</code> example. Some standard best practices: </p>

<ul>
<li>put all your tests in a <code>tests</code> folder at the root of your project.</li>
<li>write one test module for each python module you're testing.</li>
<li>test modules should start with the word <code>test</code>.</li>
<li>test methods should start with the word <code>test</code>. </li>
</ul>

<p>When you've become comfortable with <code>unittest</code> (and it shouldn't take long), there are some nice extensions to it that will make life easier as your tests grow in number and scope:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/"" rel=""nofollow"">nose</a> -- easily find and run all your tests, and more.</li>

1021,502610,1,2,python,Running SimpleXMLRPCServer in separate thread and shutting down,"<p>I have a class that I wish to test via SimpleXMLRPCServer in python. The way I have my unit test set up is that I create a new thread, and start SimpleXMLRPCServer in that. Then I run all the test, and finally shut down.</p>

<p>This is my ServerThread:</p>

<pre><code>class ServerThread(Thread):
    running = True
    def run(self):
        self.server = #Creates and starts SimpleXMLRPCServer

        while (self.running):
            self.server.handle_request()

    def stop(self):
        self.running = False
        self.server.server_close()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that calling ServerThread.stop(), followed by Thread.stop() and Thread.join() will not cause the thread to stop properly if it's already waiting for a request in handle_request. And since there doesn't seem to be any interrupt or timeout mechanisms here that I can use, I am at a loss for how I can cleanly shut down the server thread.</p>
","<p>Two suggestions.</p>

<p>Suggestion One is to use a separate process instead of a separate thread.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a stand-alone XMLRPC server program.</p></li>
<li><p>Start it with <code>subprocess.Popen()</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Kill it when the test is done.  In standard OS's (not Windows) the kill works nicely.  In Windows, however, there's no trivial kill function, but there are recipes for this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The other suggestion is to have a function in your XMLRPC server which causes server self-destruction.  You define a function that calls <code>sys.exit()</code> or <code>os.abort()</code> or raises a similar exception that will stop the process.</p>

<p>A) The manager process (the one who holds the actual socket connections) puts received packets into a shared queue (the one from the multiprocessing module), and worker processes pull the packets out of the queue, process them and send the results back to the client.</p>

<p>B) The manager process (the one who holds the actual socket connections) launches a deferred thread and then calls the apply() function on the process pool. Once the result returns from the worker process, the manager sends the result back to the client.</p>

<p>In both implementations, the worker processes use thread pools so they can work on more than one packet at once (since there will be a lot of database querying).</p>

964,471660,2,2,python,Python/Twisted multiuser server - what is more efficient?,"<p>In Python, if I want my server to scale well CPU-wise, I obviously need to spawn multiple processes. I was wondering which is better (using Twisted):</p>

<p>A) The manager process (the one who holds the actual socket connections) puts received packets into a shared queue (the one from the multiprocessing module), and worker processes pull the packets out of the queue, process them and send the results back to the client.</p>

<p>B) The manager process (the one who holds the actual socket connections) launches a deferred thread and then calls the apply() function on the process pool. Once the result returns from the worker process, the manager sends the result back to the client.</p>

<p>In both implementations, the worker processes use thread pools so they can work on more than one packet at once (since there will be a lot of database querying).</p>
","<p>I think that B is problematic. The thread would only run on one CPU, and even if it runs a process, the thread is still running. A may be better.</p>

<p>It is best to try and measure both in terms of time and see which one is faster and which one scales well. However, I'll reiterate that I highly doubt that B will scale well.</p>

778,394500,1,2,python,Is there a simple way in Python to create a file which can be written to in one thread and read in a different one?,"<p>In the python program I'm writing, I've got a thread which iterates over a large structure in memory and writes it incrementally into a file-like object.  I've got another thread which takes a file-like object and writes it to disk.  Is there an easy way to connect the two, such that any data input from the first thread will be buffered for the second?</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm trying to pass data to subprocess.Popen().  The process will read from stdin, but you cannot pass a ""file-like"" object to Popen because it calls stdin.fileno() and blows up unless you have a real file.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to pass the PIPE argument to Popen, which allows you to use proc.stdin as a file-like object.  But if you've already got a file-like object, there doesn't seem to be a great way to yolk the two of them together.</p>
","<p>I think there is something wrong in the design if you already have a file-like object if you want your data to end up in the subprocess. You should then arrange that they get written into the subprocess in the first place, rather than having them written into something else file-like first. Whoever is writing the data should allow the flexibility to specify the output stream, and that should be the subprocess pipe.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the writer insists on creating its own stream object, you should let it complete writing, and only then start the subprocess, feeding it from the result of first write. E.g. if it is a StringIO object, take its value after writing, and write it into the pipe; no need for thread synchronization here.</p>

624,311300,0,2,python,Admin generic inlines for multi-table subclassed models broken --- any alternatives?,"<p>Here's what I'm trying to do, and failing...</p>

<p>I have a File model which has a generic-relation to other objects:</p>

<pre><code>class File(models.Model):
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey()
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='files/%Y/%m/%d')
    # etc....
</code></pre>

<p>I also want to have a sub-class of File to deal with the specific case of images to be displayed in-page, rather than downloaded:</p>

<pre><code>class Image(File):
    file = models.ImageField(upload_to='files/%Y/%m/%d')
</code></pre>

<p>All of the above works fine, including generic inlines of the File model, until I want to use a generic-inline of the Image model --- the save process fails to create the base class instance and so raises an error stating that the Image.file_ptr (the 'secret' foreign key to the base class) cannot be None.</p>

<p>So, basically, generic inlines do not properly support multi-table inheritance at the moment.</p>

<p>It's quite likely that I'm making this more complicated than it need be, so can anyone suggest either a fix for this problem, or a better way of achieving the same end?</p>

<p>Please let me know if you need further clarification.</p>
","<p>Inheritance can be implemented two ways in a relational model.</p>

<p>A subclass can be a new table with all the same columns as the superclass repeated.  This works well when you have an abstract superclass or subclass features that override the superclass.</p>

<p>A subclass can be just the unique columns with a join to the superclass table.  This works well when you have a concrete superclass.</p>

<p>In your case, it looks you might have the following.</p>

<pre><code>class FileFacts( models.Model ):
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey()

class DownloadFile( models.Model ):
    facts = models.ForeignKey( FileFacts )

class InlineImage( models.Model ):
    facts = models.ForeignKey( FileFacts )
    file = models.ImageField(upload_to='files/%Y/%m/%d')

<p>This is my preference for handling a subclass-like model.</p>

7,19030,2,2,python,How to check set of files conform to a naming scheme,"<p>I have a bunch of files (TV episodes, although that is fairly arbitrary) that I want to check match a specific naming/organisation scheme..</p>

<p>Currently: I have three arrays of regex, one for valid filenames, one for files missing an episode name, and one for valid paths.</p>

<p>Then, I loop though each valid-filename regex, if it matches, append it to a ""valid"" dict, if not, do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs, if it matches this I append it to an ""invalid"" dict with an error code (2:'missing epsiode name'), if it matches neither, it gets added to invalid with the 'malformed name' error code.</p>

<p>The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/checktveps/tree/8a6dc68ad61e684c8d8f0ca1dc37a22d1c51aa82/2checkTvEps.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>I want to add a rule that checks for the presence of a folder.jpg file in each directory, but to add this would make the code substantially more messy in it's current state.. </p>

<p>How could I write this system in a more expandable way?</p>

<p>The rules it needs to check would be..</p>

<ul>
<li>File is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23] - Episode Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xSpecial02] - Special Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xExtra01] - Extra Name.avi</code></li>
<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>
</ul>

<p>.any ideas? While I'm trying to check TV episodes, this concept/code should be able to apply to many things..</p>

<p>The only thought I had was a list of dicts in the format:</p>

<pre><code>checker = [
{
    'name':'valid files',
    'type':'file',
    'function':check_valid(), # runs check_valid() on all files
    'status':0 # if it returns True, this is the status the file gets
}
</code></pre>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a list of all the files</li>
<li>Check for ""required"" files</li>
</ol>

<p>You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:</p>

<pre><code>checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):</p>

<pre><code>check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Split the filename based on the delimiter.</li>
<li>Check each of the parts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the <code>parts</code> and <code>patterns</code> have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.</p>

<p>Ignored and required files can be listed.  The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of <code>svn:ignore</code> properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.</p>

<p>Here <code>start_dir</code> would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.</p>

<p>The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of <code>parts</code>, which makes sense but adds complexity.</p>

<p>Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?</p>

","<p>Well, I work in both Perl and Python, and my day job is supporting a network monitoring software. Most of the import points have already been covered, but I'll consolidate/reiterate here: </p>

If you're planning on parsing a lot of text, it will be easier to do this ""quick and dirty"" in Perl than it will be in Python. Both can do it, but Python requires an OOP approach and it just isn't as easy as Perl's inline regex syntax. </p></li>
<li><p>Use libraries - many, many people have done this task before you so look around for a suitable lib like Net::Ping in Perl or the <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/409689/"">icmplib</a> in Python or <a href=""http://svn.pylucid.net/pylucid/CodeSnippets/ping.py"">this ping.py</a> code. </p></li>
<li><p>Use threads or asynchronous pings - otherwise pinging is going to take forever for example see <a href=""http://www.wellho.net/solutions/python-python-threads-a-first-example.html"">this recipe</a> using threads to run pings simultaneously.

6,19030,0,2,python,How to check set of files conform to a naming scheme,"<p>I have a bunch of files (TV episodes, although that is fairly arbitrary) that I want to check match a specific naming/organisation scheme..</p>

<p>Currently: I have three arrays of regex, one for valid filenames, one for files missing an episode name, and one for valid paths.</p>

<p>Then, I loop though each valid-filename regex, if it matches, append it to a ""valid"" dict, if not, do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs, if it matches this I append it to an ""invalid"" dict with an error code (2:'missing epsiode name'), if it matches neither, it gets added to invalid with the 'malformed name' error code.</p>

<p>The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/checktveps/tree/8a6dc68ad61e684c8d8f0ca1dc37a22d1c51aa82/2checkTvEps.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>I want to add a rule that checks for the presence of a folder.jpg file in each directory, but to add this would make the code substantially more messy in it's current state.. </p>

<p>How could I write this system in a more expandable way?</p>

<p>The rules it needs to check would be..</p>

<ul>
<li>File is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23] - Episode Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xSpecial02] - Special Name.avi</code> or <code>Show Name - [01xExtra01] - Extra Name.avi</code></li>
<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>
<li>each <code>Show Name/season 1/</code> folder should contain ""folder.jpg""</li>
</ul>

<p>.any ideas? While I'm trying to check TV episodes, this concept/code should be able to apply to many things..</p>

<p>The only thought I had was a list of dicts in the format:</p>

<pre><code>checker = [
{
    'name':'valid files',
    'type':'file',
    'function':check_valid(), # runs check_valid() on all files
    'status':0 # if it returns True, this is the status the file gets
}
</code></pre>
","<p>maybe you should take the approach of defaulting to: ""the filename is correct"" and work from there to disprove that statement:</p>

<p>with the fact that you only allow filenames with: 'show name', 'season number x episode number' and 'episode name', you know for certain that these items should be separated by a ""-"" (dash) so you have to have 2 of those for a filename to be correct.<br>
if that checks out, you can use your code to check that the show name matches the show name as seen in the parent's parent folder (case insensitive i assume), the season number matches the parents folder numeric value (with or without an extra 0 prepended).</p>

<p>if however you don't see the correct amount of dashes you instantly know that there is something wrong and stop before the rest of the tests etc.</p>

<p>and separately you can check if the file <code>folder.jpg</code> exists and take the necessary actions. <strong>or</strong> do that first and filter that file from the rest of the files in that folder.</p>

<p>So, I want both of the dialogs to access the gamePlayer object.  At the moment, the only way I can think of doing it is to create the gamePlayer object as a global object, but these are normally frowned upon - is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>There is a method of passing objects in event bindings in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/173687?sort=votes"" rel=""nofollow"">this question</a>, but it doesn't feel quite right.</p>

<p>Is learning to implement the MVC pattern the way forward here?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>You can pass a gamePlayer object to <code>__init__</code> as another argument.</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, parent, id, title, gamePlayer ):
    ...etc...
</code></pre>

<p>In the long run, this isn't ideal.  </p>

<p>You should separate building an empty panel from loading that panel with data.  The empty panel is one thing, populating it with data from the model is unrelated.</p>

<p>Populating a frame with data is where you must be given the gamePlayer object which will be used to update the various display widgets.</p>

<p>I'd suggest you look at the Document-View framework for guidance on this.  <a href=""http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_docviewoverview.html#docviewoverview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_docviewoverview.html#docviewoverview</a>.  Unfortunately, there aren't any good Python examples of this, so it can be confusing to convert from the C++ code to Python.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you have a ""document"" which is the main object (""gamePlayer"") that is being displayed.  Each Frame is a view of that document.</p>

","<p>You really need to be more specific: What is it that you want to test in your WS-consumer? That it calls the right WS? This looks a bit pointless - WS are a perfect place for mocking whatever may be called - without anything being called.</p>

<p>In order to test the consumer you'd otherwise be writing a Webservice that mocks the original, right? I'd suppose that the communication protocol that goes through the wire is not the clients domain - e.g. it's generated. So the only thing a WS-consumer's client sees is the interface. And there's nothing to test in an interface.</p>

<p>It might be that I completely misunderstood your question - please clarify if I did. I'll revise the answer then.</p>

464,234590,3,2,python,Solving the shared-server security problem for Python,"<p>So my group is trying to set up a shared-server environment for various and sundry web services.  I think we've settled on setting <code>disable_functions</code> and <code>disable_classes</code> site wide in <code>php.ini</code> and <code>php_admin_value</code> to force <code>open_basedir</code> in each app's <code>httpd.conf</code>
 for php scripts, and passenger's <a href=""http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#user_switching"" rel=""nofollow"">user switching</a> for ruby scripts.  </p>

<p>We still need to find something for python though.  Passenger does support python, but not for per-application security for specific sub-directories (it's all or nothing at the domain level).  </p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>(And if any of the previous doesn't make sense - well, I'm the guy who's supposed to set up the python support, not the guy who set up the php or ruby support, so there's still some ""and then some magic happens"" steps in there from my perspective).</p>
","<p>Well, there is a system called <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv"" rel=""nofollow"">virtualenv</a> which allows you to run Python in a sort of safe environment, and configure/load/shutdown these environments on the fly. I don't know much about it, but you should take a serious look into it; here is the description from its web page (just Google it and you'll find it):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions. Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version 2. How can you use both these applications? If you install everything into /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (or whatever your platform's standard location is), it's easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn't be upgraded.</p>
  
  <p>Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be? If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those libraries can break the application.</p>
  
  <p>Also, what if you can't install packages into the global site-packages directory? For instance, on a shared host.</p>
  
  <p>In all these cases, virtualenv can help you. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn't share libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn't use the globally installed libraries either).</p>

  the required input parameters. On clicking Invoke the SOAP request is
  sent to the server and the response is parsed to display the return
  value.</p>

647,328490,5,2,python,Monitoring a displays state in python?,"<p>How can I tell when Windows is changing a monitors power state?</p>
","<p>It seems that, when Windows wants to start the screen saver or turn the monitor off, it will send a <code>WM_SYSCOMMAND</code> to the topmost window with a <code>wParam</code> of <code>SC_SCREENSAVE</code> (to start the screen saver) or a <code>wParam</code> of <code>SC_MONITORPOWER</code> and a <code>lParam</code> of 1 or 2 (to turn the monitor off). This message will then be passed to <code>DefWindowProc</code>, which will actually do the action. So, if your window happens to be the topmost one, you can intercept these events and ignore them (or do anything else you want before passing them to <code>DefWindowProc</code>).</p>

<p>On Windows Vista, there seems to be a more intuitive, and more reliable, way to know the monitor power state. You call <code>RegisterPowerSettingNotification</code> to tell the system to send your window a <code>WM_POWERBROADCAST</code> message with a <code>wParam</code> of <code>PBT_POWERSETTINGCHANGE</code> and a <code>lParam</code> pointing to a <code>POWERBROADCAST_SETTING</code> structure.</p>

<p>I cannot test either of them since I currently do not have any computer with Windows nearby. I hope, however, they point you in the right direction.</p>

753,383010,7,1,python,"Using Python's ctypes to pass/read a parameter declared as ""struct_name *** param_name""?","<p>I am trying to use Python's ctypes library to access some methods in the scanning library <a href=""http://www.sane-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SANE</a>.  This is my first experience with ctypes and the first time I have had to deal with C datatypes in over a year so there is a fair learning curve here, but I think even without that this particular declaration would be troublesome:</p>

<pre><code>extern SANE_Status sane_get_devices (const SANE_Device *** device_list, SANE_Bool local_only);
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, I've successfully dealt with <code>SANE_Status</code> (an enum) and <code>SANE_Bool</code> (a typedef to <code>c_int</code>).  Those were both simple.  That first parameter, on the other hand, is causing me all sorts of grief.  I'm unfamiliar with the ""<code>***</code>"" notation to begin with and my tracer bullets so far have yielded nothing more than garbage data.  How do I format the input to this function such that I can read back a list of my Python structure-objects?  For reference, the C structure being referenced is:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    SANE_String_Const name; /* unique device name */
    SANE_String_Const vendor;   /* device vendor string */
    SANE_String_Const model;    /* device model name */
    SANE_String_Const type; /* device type (e.g., ""flatbed scanner"") */
 }
SANE_Device;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>SANE_String_Const</code> is defined as a <code>c_char_p</code>.</p>

<p>My Python/ctypes version of this object is:</p>

<pre><code>class SANE_Device(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        (""name"", c_char_p),
        (""vendor"", c_char_p),
        (""model"", c_char_p),
        (""type"", c_char_p)]
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions on what I should pass in such that I can get the expected behavior (a list of structure-objects) out of this?  All responses appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>Using the following, I was able to retrieve a correct SANE_Device Python structure:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer(SANE_Device())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents.name
</code></pre>

<p>However, 1) yuck and 2) that seems like it would only work if there is a single result.  I can't len() on <code>devices.contents.contents</code> or <code>devices.contents.contents.contents</code>.  How am I to determine the number of results?  The SANE docs specify that ""If the function executes successfully, it stores a pointer to a NULL terminated array of pointers to SANE_Device structures in *device_list"".  Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>I was able to pass an ten-item array and then access the first element using:</p>

<pre><code>devices = pointer(pointer(pointer((SANE_Device * 10)())))
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(devices, c_int(0))
print status, devices, devices.contents.contents.contents[0].name
</code></pre>

<p>However, ten is obviously an arbitrary number and I have no way of determining the actual number of results.  Trying to access <code>devices.contents.contents.contents[1].name</code> when only one device is connected causes a segmentation fault.  There must be a proper way of dealing with variable-length constructs like these in ctypes.</p>
","<p>A <code>const SANE_Device ***</code> is a three-level pointer: it's a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a constant SANE_Device.  You can use the program <a href=""http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/man_pages/cdecl1.html"">cdecl</a> to decipher complicated C/C++ type definitions.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.sane-project.org/html/doc012.html"">SANE documentation</a>, <code>SANE_get_devices()</code> will store a pointer to a NULL-terminated list of pointers to SANE devices if successful.  Thus, the proper way to call it is to declare a variable of type <code>const SANE_Device **</code> (i.e. a pointer to a pointer to a constant `SANE_Device), and pass in the address of that pointer:</p>

<pre><code>const SANE_Device **device_list;
SANE_get_devices(&amp;device_list, local_only);  // check return value
// Now, device_list[0] points to the first device,
// device_list[1] points to the second device, etc.
// Once you hit a NULL pointer, that's the end of the list:
int num_devices = 0;
while(device_list[num_devices] != NULL)
    num_devices++;
// num_devices now stores the total number of devices
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is how you would call it from C code.  I've skimmed the documentation on ctypes, and it appears that you want to use the <code>byref</code> function to pass the argument by reference, and that the value you pass should be a POINTER to a POINTER to a SANE_Device.  Note the distinction between <code>pointer</code> and <code>POINTER</code>: the former creates a pointer to an <em>instance</em>, whereas the latter creates a pointer to a <em>type</em>.  Thus, I'm guessing the following code will work:</p>

<pre><code>// SANE_Device declared as you had it
devices = POINTER(POINTER(SANE_Device))()  // devices is a NULL pointer to a pointer to a SANE_Device
status = libsane.sane_get_devices(byref(devices), c_int(0))
if status != successful:   // replace this by whatever success is
    print error
else:
    num_devices = 0
    // Convert NULL-terminated C list into Python list
    device_list = []
    while devices[num_devices]:
        device_list.append(devices[num_devices].contents)  // use .contents here since each entry in the C list is itself a pointer
        num_devices += 1
    print device_list
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit] I've tested the above code using a very simple placeholder for <code>SANE_get_devices</code>, and it works.</p>

<p>I think this is the key to your answer. Before going to a 3d implementation and writing all the code in the world to create this feature, you need to look at the presentation software.  Chances are, your options will boil down to two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Animated Gif</li>
<li>Custom Presentation Scripts</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, an animated gif is not ideal due to the fact that it repeats when it is done rendering, and to make it last a long time would make a large gif.</p>

<p>Custom Presentation Scripts would probably be the other way to allow him to bring it up in a presentation without running any side-programs, or doing anything strange. I'm not sure which presentation application is the target, but this could be valuable information.</p>

<p>He sounds like he's more non-technical and requesting something he doesn't realize will be difficult. I think you should come up with some options, explain the difficulty in implementing them, and suggest another solution that falls into the 'bang for your buck' range.</p>

756,383760,-1,1,python,"Django objects.filter, how ""expensive"" would this be?","<p>I am trying to make a search view in Django. It is a search form with freetext input + some options to select, so that you can filter on years and so on. This is some of the code I have in the view so far, the part that does the filtering. And I would like some input on how expensive this would be on the database server.</p>

<p><code>
    soknad_list = Soknad.objects.all()</p>

<pre><code>if var1:
    soknad_list = soknad_list.filter(pub_date__year=var1)

if var2:
    soknad_list = soknad_list.filter(muncipality__name__exact=var2)

if var3:
    soknad_list = soknad_list.filter(genre__name__exact=var3)

# TEXT SEARCH
stop_word_list = re.compile(STOP_WORDS, re.IGNORECASE)
search_term = '%s' % request.GET['q']
cleaned_search_term = stop_word_list.sub('', search_term)
cleaned_search_term = cleaned_search_term.strip()
if len(cleaned_search_term) != 0:

<p></code></p>

<p>So what I do is, first make a list of all objects, then I check which variables exists (I fetch these with GET on an earlier point) and then I filter the results if they exists. But this doesn't seem too elegant, it probably does a lot of queries to achieve the result, so is there a better way to this?</p>

<p>It does exactly what I want, but I guess there is a better/smarter way to do this. Any ideas?</p>
","<p>As Aaron mentioned, you should get a hold of the query text that is going to be run against the database and use an EXPLAIN (or other some method) to view the query execution plan. Once you have a hold of the execution plan for the query you can see what is going on in the database itself. There are a lot of operations that see very expensive to run through procedural code that are very trivial for any database to run, especially if you provide indexes that the database can use for speeding up your query.</p>

<p>If I read your question correctly, you're retrieving a result set of all rows in the Soknad table. Once you have these results back you use the filter() method to trim down your results meet your criteria. From looking at the Django documentation, it looks like this will do an in-memory filter rather than re-query the database (of course, this really depends on which data access layer you're using and not on Django itself).</p>

<p>The most optimal solution would be to use a full-text search engine (Lucene, ferret, etc) to handle this for you. If that is not available or practical the next best option would be to to construct a query predicate (WHERE clause) before issuing your query to the database and let the database perform the filtering. </p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> as with all things that involve the database, the real answer is 'it depends.' The best suggestion is to try out several different approaches using data that is close to production and benchmark them over at least 3 iterations before settling on a final solution to the problem. It may be just as fast, or even faster, to filter in memory rather than filter in the database.</p>

704,360600,1,1,python,Regular Expressions in unicode strings,"<p>I have some unicode text that I want to clean up using regular expressions.  For example I have cases where u'(2'.  This exists because for formatting reasons the closing paren ends up in an adjacent html cell.  My initial solution to this problem was to look ahead at the contents of the next cell and using a string function determine if it held the closing paren.  I knew this was not a great solution but it worked.  Now I want to fix it but I can't seem to make the regular expression work.   </p>

^ at the beginning of the string I want to find<br />
( an open paren, the paren has to be backslashed because it is a special character<br />
\d I also want to find a single digit<br />
[ I am creating a special character class<br />
^ I don't want to find what follows<br />
) which is a close paren<br />
$ at the end of the string  </p>

<p>And of course the plot thickens I made a silly assumption that because I placed a \d I would not find (33 but I am wrong so I added a {1} to my regular expression and that did not help, it matched (3333, so my problem is more complicated than I thought.

<p>This is easy if i get the questionid, i can return all answers related to that question  but when am displaying the entire list of question it becomes a bit tricky to display on the side the count showing the total count.</p>

<p>I don't know if am clear but just think how stackoverflow displays its questions with answer,views count next to each question! </p>
","<p>If you're willing to use trunk, you can take advantage of the brand new annotate() QuerySet method added just a week or so ago, which solves this exact problem:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/</a></p>

<p>If you want to stick with Django 1.0, you can achieve this in a slightly less elegant way using the select argument of the extra() QuerySet method. There's an example of exactly what you are talking about using extra() here:</p>

<p>Finally, if you need this to be really high performance you can denormalise the count in to a separate column. I've got some examples of how to do this in the unit testing part of my presentation here:</p>

401,207290,1,1,python,extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string,"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>

402,207290,0,1,python,extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string,"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
","<p>After posting this, reading the replies so far (thanks everyone!), and thinking about the problem for a while, here is the best approach I've been able to come up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the first <code>${</code>.</li>
<li>Find the next <code>}</code> after that.</li>
<li>Feed whatever's in between to <code>compile()</code>.  If it works, stick a fork in it and we're done.</li>
<li>Otherwise, keep extending the string by looking for subsequent occurences of <code>}</code>.  As soon as something compiles, return it.</li>
<li>If we run out of <code>}</code> without being able to compile anything, use the results of the last compilation attempt to give information about where the problem lies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Advantages of this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code is quite short and easy to understand.</li>
<li>It's pretty efficient -- optimal, even, in the case where the expression contains no <code>}</code>.  Worst-case seems like it wouldn't be too bad either.</li>
<li>It works on many expressions that contain <code>${</code> and/or <code>}</code>.</li>
<li>No external dependencies.  No need to import <em>anything</em>, in fact.  (This surprised me.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes it grabs too much or too little.  See below for an example of the latter.  I could imagine a scary example where you have two expressions and the first one is subtly wrong and the algorithm ends up mistakenly grabbing the whole thing and everything in between and returning it as valid, though I haven't been able to demonstrate this.  Perhaps things are not so bad as I fear.  I don't think misunderstandings can be avoided in general -- the problem definition is kind of slippery -- but it seems like it ought to be possible to do better, especially if one were willing to trade simplicity or execution time.</li>
<li>I haven't done any benchmarks, but I could imagine there being faster alternatives, especially in cases that involve lots of <code>}</code> in the expression.  That could be a big deal if one wanted to apply this technique to sizable blocks of Python code rather than just very short expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my implementation.</p>

<pre><code>def findExpr(s, i0=0, begin='${', end='}', compArgs=('&lt;string&gt;', 'eval')):
  assert '\n' not in s, 'line numbers not implemented'
  i0 = s.index(begin, i0) + len(begin)
  i1 = s.index(end, i0)
  code = errMsg = None
  while code is None and errMsg is None:
    expr = s[i0:i1]
    try: code = compile(expr, *compArgs)
    except SyntaxError, e:
      i1 = s.find(end, i1 + 1)
      if i1 &lt; 0: errMsg, i1 = e.msg, i0 + e.offset
  return i0, i1, code, errMsg
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the docstring with some illustrations in doctest format, which I didn't insert into the middle of the function above only because it's long and I feel like the code is easier to read without it.</p>

<pre><code>'''
Search s for a (possibly invalid) Python expression bracketed by begin
and end, which default to '${' and '}'.  Return a 4-tuple.

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'foo ${a*b + c*d} bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, s[i0:i1], errMsg
(6, 15, 'a*b + c*d', None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join('%02x' % ord(byte) for byte in code.co_code)
'65 00 00 65 01 00 14 65 02 00 65 03 00 14 17 53'
&gt;&gt;&gt; code.co_names
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(code, {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4})
14
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(code, {'a': 'a', 'b': 2, 'c': 'c', 'd': 4})
'aacccc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(code, {'a': None})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NameError: name 'b' is not defined

Expressions containing start and/or end are allowed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '{foo ${{""}"": ""${""}[""}""]} bar}'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, s[i0:i1], errMsg
(7, 23, '{""}"": ""${""}[""}""]', None)

If the first match is syntactically invalid Python, i0 points to the
start of the match, i1 points to the parse error, code is None and
errMsg contains a message from the compiler.

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '{foo ${qwerty asdf zxcvbnm!!!} ${7} bar}'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, s[i0:i1], errMsg
(7, 18, 'qwerty asdf', 'invalid syntax')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print code
None

If a second argument is given, start searching there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s, i1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, s[i0:i1], errMsg
(33, 34, '7', None)

Raise ValueError if there are no further matches.

&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s, i1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: substring not found

In ambiguous cases, match the shortest valid expression.  This is not
always ideal behavior.

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '{foo ${x or {} # return {} instead of None} bar}'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, code, errMsg = findExpr(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i0, i1, s[i0:i1], errMsg
(7, 25, 'x or {} # return {', None)

This implementation must not be used with multi-line strings.  It does
not adjust line number information in the returned code object, and it
does not take the line number into account when computing the offset
of a parse error.

<p>Is there a way to make this more readable in python?</p>
","<p>Unless I am mistaking your basic premise here, there's nothing to stop you from writing a class that parses your own custom syntax, and then using that custom syntax as a single-argument string:</p>

<pre><code>Allocation(""Param 1=Check Up; Param 2=Mean Value Theorem;"")
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, semicolons act as the name-value-pair separators, and equals represents the name-value separator. Moreover, you can easily configure your parser to accept custom delimiters as part of the object constructor.</p>

<p>If it seems too daunting to write a parser, consider that (for a syntax such as this) you could obtain your values by simply splitting the string on </p>

<pre><code>/\s*;\s*/
</code></pre>

<p>and then on</p>

<pre><code>/\s*=\s*/
</code></pre>

<p>to quickly obtain the name-value pairs. You also have the option to choose from any of several argument parsers already written for Python.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this does not use Python as the argument parser, which is a consideration you will have to balance against the simplicity of an approach such as this.</p>

","<p>I'd imagine that there would be some way to do it.  But I feel compelled to ask, is there really a big enough difference in readability from this</p>

<pre><code>Allocation(Param1 = Val1, Param2 = Val2 )
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>Allocation(Param 1 = Val1, Param 2 = Val2 )
</code></pre>

<p>to make that big a difference?  I'm sure there's a way to do what you want to do, but my first concern is if the effort involved would be worth the result.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my goal is to provide a DSL which can be used for data entry into the system. In the above scenario, params would be people names and values would be percentages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a better understanding of what you want to do now, but I still think that you might end up having to sacrifice some readability to get what you want.  Personally, I would go with something like:</p>

<pre><code>Allocation(
    { 'name1' : value1,
      'name1' : value2, }
)
</code></pre>

<p>If that's not something you can go with, then you might want to reconsider whether you want to use Python for your DSL or go with something home-grown.  Allowing whitespace allows too many ambiguities for most programming languages to allow it.</p>

<p>If you still want to pursue this with using python, you might want to consider posting to the C-API SIG (<a href=""http://www.python.org/community/sigs/"" rel=""nofollow"">SIGS</a>) or maybe the <a href=""http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev"" rel=""nofollow"">python-dev list</a> (as a last resort).  The only way that I can see to do this would be to embed the python interpreter into a C/C++ program and do some kind of hacking with it (which can be difficult!).</p>

def _replace_whitespace(self,name):
    name = str(name)
    return name.replace("" "", ""_"")
</code></pre>

<p>Also in the _replace_whitespace method I would like to have some kind of cleaning routine which takes out all illegal characters which could cause processing.</p>

<p>Basically I want to write the email to the inbox directory in a standard way.</p>

<p>Am i doing something wrong here?</p>
","<p>This isn't refactoring (it doesn't need refactoring as far as I can see), but some suggestions:</p>

<p>You should use the email package rather than rfc822.  Replace rfc822.Message with email.Message, and use email.Utils.parseaddr(msg[""From""]) to get the name and email address, and msg[""Subject""] to get the subject.</p>

<p>Use os.path.join to create the path.  This:</p>

<pre><code>emailpath = str(self._emailpath + self._inboxfolder + ""\\"" + email + ""_"" + msg.getheader(""Subject"") + "".eml"")
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>emailpath = os.path.join(self._emailpath + self._inboxfolder, email + ""_"" + msg.getheader(""Subject"") + "".eml"")
</code></pre>

<p>(If self._inboxfolder starts with a slash or self._emailpath ends with one, you could replace the first + with a comma also).</p>

<p>It doesn't really hurt anything, but you should probably not use ""file"" as a variable name, since it shadows a built-in type (checkers like pylint or pychecker would warn you about that).</p>

<p>If you're not using self.popinstance outside of this function (seems unlikely given that you connect and quit within the function), then there's no point making it an attribute of self.  Just use ""popinstance"" by itself.</p>

<p>Use xrange instead of range.</p>

<p>Instead of just importing StringIO, do this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import cStringIO as StringIO
except ImportError:
    import StringIO
</code></pre>

<p>If this is a POP mailbox that can be accessed by more than one client at a time, you might want to put a try/except around the RETR call to continue on if you can't retrieve one message.</p>

<p>As John said, use ""\n"".join rather than string.join, use try/finally to only close the file if it is opened, and pass the logging parameters separately.</p>

<p>The one refactoring issue I could think of would be that you don't really need to parse the whole message, since you're just dumping a copy of the raw bytes, and all you want is the From and Subject headers.  You could instead use popinstance.top(0) to get the headers, create the message (blank body) from that, and use that for the headers.  Then do a full RETR to get the bytes.  This would only be worth doing if your messages were large (and so parsing them took a long time).  I would definitely measure before I made this optimisation.</p>

<p>For your function to sanitise for the names, it depends how nice you want the names to be, and how certain you are that the email and subject make the filename unique (seems fairly unlikely).  You could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>emailpath = """".join([c for c in emailpath if c in (string.letters + string.digits + ""_ "")])
</code></pre>

<p>And you'd end up with just alphanumeric characters and the underscore and space, which seems like a readable set.  Given that your filesystem (with Windows) is probably case insensitive, you could lowercase that also (add .lower() to the end).  You could use emailpath.translate if you want something more complex.</p>

<li>Instead of <code>logger.info (""foo %s %s"" % (bar, baz))</code>, use <code>""foo %s %s"", bar, baz</code>. This avoids the overhead of string formatting if the message won't be printed.</li>
<li>Put a <code>try...finally</code> around opening <code>emailpath</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>'\n'.join (body)</code>, instead of <code>string.join (body, '\n')</code>.</li>

","<p>One of the most complete geography/mapping systems available for Python that I know about is <a href=""http://geodjango.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">GeoDjango</a>.  This works on top of the <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Django</a>, an MVC framework.  With it comes a large collection of polygon, line and distance calculation tools that can even take into account the curvature of the earth's surface if need be.</p>

<p>With that said, the quickest way I can think of to produce a 3D map is using a height map.  Create a two dimensional list of tuples containing (x, y, z) coordinates.  Each tuple represents an evenly spaced point on a grid, mapped out by the dimensions of the array.  This creates a simple plane along the X and Z axes; the ground plane.  The polygons that make up the plane are quads, a polygon with four sides.</p>

<p>Next, to produce the three dimensional height, simply give each point a Y value.  This will create peaks and valleys in your ground plane.</p>

<p>How you render this will be up to you, and converting your grid of points into a polygon format that something like OpenGL can understand may take some work, but have a look at <a href=""http://vpython.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Visual Python</a>, its the simplest 3D library I've seen for Python.</p>

","<p>If you want to define a variable to the global namespace from inside a function, and thereby make it accessible by other functions in this space, you can use the global keyword. Here's some examples</p>

<pre><code>varA = 5   #A normal declaration of an integer in the main ""global"" namespace

def funcA():
    print varA #This works, because the variable was defined in the global namespace
               #and functions have read access to this.
def changeA():
    varA = 2  #This however, defines a variable in the function's own namespace
              #Because of this, it's not accessible by other functions.
              #It has also replaced the global variable, though only inside this function
def newVar():
    global varB #By using the global keyword, you assign this variable to the global namespace
    varB = 5

def funcB():
    print varB #Making it accessible to other functions
</code></pre>

<p>Conclusion: variables defined in a function stays in the function's namespace. It still has access to the global namespace for reading only, unless the variable has been called with the global keyword.</p>

<p>The term global isn't entirely global as it may seem at first. It's practically only a link to the lowest namespace in the file you're working in. Global keywords cannot be accessed in another module.</p>

814,408810,1,1,python,Catch MainLoop exceptions and displaying them in MessageDialogs,"<p>I have a wxPython application that relies on an external config file.  I want provide friendly message dialogs that show up if there are any config errors.  I've tried to make this work by wrapping my app.MainLoop() call in a try/except statement.</p>

<p>The code below works for the init code in my MainWindow frame class, but doesn't catch any exceptions that occur within the MainLoop.  How can I catch these exceptions as well?</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = MyApp(0)
    try:
        MainWindow(None, -1, 'My Cool App')
        app.MainLoop()
    except ConfigParser.Error, error_message:
        messagebox = wx.MessageDialog(None, error_message, 'Configuration Error', wx.OK | wx.ICON_ERROR)
        messagebox.ShowModal()
</code></pre>

<p>I've read some mention of an OnExceptionInMainLoop method that can be overridden in the wx.App class, but the source I read must be out of date (2004) since wx.App no longer seems to have a method by that name.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I need to be able to catch unhandled exceptions during my mainloop so that I can further handle them and display them in error dialogs, not pass silently, and not terminate the app.</p>

<p>The sys.excepthook solution is too low level and doesn't play nice with the wxPython mainloop thread.  While the link to the other answer does the same try/except wrapping around the mainloop which doesn't work due, once again, to wxPython spawning a different thread for the app/ui.</p>
","<p>I coded something like this for <a href=""http://chandlerproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Chandler</a>, where any unhandled exceptions pop up a window with the stack and other info, and users can put in additional comments (what did they do when it happened etc.) and submit it for Chandler developers. A bit like the <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Talkback"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Talkback</a> (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Crash_reporting"" rel=""nofollow"">nowadays</a> they use Breakpad I believe) feature if you will.</p>

<p>To do this in wxPython, you need to provide redirect parameter to wx.App. This will pop up <a href=""http://www.wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.PyOnDemandOutputWindow-class.html"" rel=""nofollow"">wx.PyOnDemandOutputWindow</a> (you will probably want to override it to provide a nicer looking implementation).</p>

400,207290,2,1,python,extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string,"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
","<p>I think what you're asking about is being able to insert Python code into text files to be evaluated. There are several modules that already exist to provide this kind of functionality. You can check the Python.org <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Templating wiki page</strong></a> for a comprehensive list.</p>

<p>Some google searching also turned up a few other modules you might be interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://py-templates.sourceforge.net/texttemplate/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">texttemplate</a> (part of py-templates project)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~chenna/pythonpages/template.html"" rel=""nofollow"">template module</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're really looking just into writing this yourself for whatever reason, you can also dig into this Python cookbook solution <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52305/"" rel=""nofollow"">Yet Another Python Templating Utility (YAPTU) </a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""Templating"" (copying an input file to output, on the fly inserting Python 
  expressions and statements) is a frequent need, and YAPTU is a small but 
  complete Python module for that; expressions and statements are identified 
  by arbitrary user-chosen regular-expressions.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just for the heck of it, I whipped up a severely simplistic code sample for this. I'm sure it has bugs but it illustrates a simplified version of the concept at least: </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import re

FILE = sys.argv[1]

handle = open(FILE)
fcontent = handle.read()
handle.close()

for myexpr in re.finditer(r'\${([^}]+)}', fcontent, re.M|re.S):
    text = myexpr.group(1)
    try:
        exec text
    except SyntaxError:
        print ""ERROR: unable to compile expression '%s'"" % (text)
</code></pre>

<p>Tested against the following text: </p>

<pre><code>This is some random text, with embedded python like 
${print ""foo""} and some bogus python like

${any:thing}.

And a multiline statement, just for kicks: 

${
def multiline_stmt(foo):
  print foo

multiline_stmt(""ahem"")
}

More text here.
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>[user@host]$ ./exec_embedded_python.py test.txt
foo
ERROR: unable to compile expression 'any:thing'
ahem

<p>I tested pickle and was able to save and retrieve my data.  However, I need to be able to preserve the order in the output.  One idea I have is to add another key that would be a counter so I could retrieve my data and then sort by the counter.  Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I don't want to put this into a database because it is not permanent.  </p>

<p>I marked an answer down below. It is not what I am getting, so I need to figure out if the problem is somewhere else in my code.</p>

428,217020,1,0,python,Python/editline on OS X: Â£ sign seems to be bound to ed-prev-word,"<p>On Mac OS X I canât enter a pound sterling sign (Â£) into the Python interactive shell.</p>

* Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17)
* European keyboard (Â£ is shift-3)
</code></pre>

<p>When I type shift-3 in the Python interactive shell, I seem to invoke the previous word function, i.e. the cursor will move to the start of the last âwordâ (i.e. space-delimited item) typed on the line. When Iâm back in the bash shell, typing shift-3 just produces a Â£, as expected.</p>

<p>This version of Python apparently uses editline for its interactive shell, as opposed to readline. Iâm guessing that one of the default editline key bindings binds shift-3 (or whatever editline sees when I type shift-3) to the ed-prev-word command.</p>

<p>Iâve tried a few things in my ~/.editrc file to remove this binding, and they donât have any effect:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>bind -r Â£</code></li>
<li><code>bind -r \243</code></li>
<li><code>bind -r \156</code></li>

<p>And another that causes a bus error:</p>

592,294960,1,0,python,Pycurl WRITEDATA WRITEFUNCTION collision/crash,"<p>How do I turnoff WRITEFUNCTION and WRITEDATA?</p>

<p>Using pycurl I have a class call curlUtil. In it I have pageAsString (self, URL) which returns a string. </p>

<p>To do this I setopt WRITEFUNCTION. Now in downloadFile (self, URL, fn, overwrite=0) I do an open and self.c.Setopt (pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, 0) which cause problems. Int is not a valid argument. </p>

<p>I then assumed WRITEDATA would overwrite the value or there would be a NOWRITEFUNCTION commend. NOWRITEFUNCTION didn't exist so I just used WRITEDATA and Python crashed. </p>

<p>I wrote a quick func called reboot() which closes curl, opens it again, and calls reset to put it in the default state. I call it in both pageAsString and downloadFile and there is no problem at all. But, I don't want to reinitialize curl. There might be some special options I set. </p>

<p>How do I turnoff WRITEFUNCTION and WRITEDATA?</p>
","<p>using the writefunction, instead of turning it off would save you a lot off trouble. you might want to rewrite your pageAsString by utilizing WRITEFUNCTION..</p>

233,118540,0,0,python,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>
","<p>Do you have a typo in positionChanged() ?</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(newPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you are off by one pixel because of the accuracy problems during float division. Try changing your snapToGrid() to this:</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    EPS = 1e-6
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step  + EPS) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

234,118540,0,0,python,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>
","<p>Thanks for the answer, there may be a typo, but I can't see it...</p>

<p>Unfortunately the change to snapToGrid didn't make a difference, so I don't think that's the issue.</p>

<p>It's not off by one pixel, but rather it's off by Y_STEP.  Playing around with it some more I've found that I can't get it to be exact at any point that the screen is scrolled up and also that it happens towards the top of the screen, which I suspect is ODE position zero, so I'm guessing my problem is around small or negative values.</p>

<p>Apologies, the original question does not contain enough information to really work out what the problem is.  I didn't have the extra bit of information at that point.</p>

<p>With regards to the typo note, I think I may be using the context in a confusing manner...  From the perspective of the positionChanged() function, the parameter is a new position coming in.<br />
From the perspective of the snapToGrid() function the parameter is an original position which is being changed to a snapped position.
The language is like that because part of it is in my event handling code and the other part is in my general services code.  I should have changed it for the example</p>

<li>linking with zl so zlib (we used zlib1g-dev)</li>
<li>you'd better install Pastescript BEFORE starting the Deliverance install</li>
<li>installing python-nose is not mandatory but it helps to check if everything went fine</li>

<p>Also, if it is based on time then is there any way I could just extend the time and start it going from that point again, rather than having to start again from 0? I am aware there is a time module, i just don't know much about it.</p>
","<p>If you really want your function to run and still wants user (or system) input, you have two solutions:</p>

<ol>

","<p>Those things are pernicious! Visual Studio sticks links to SourceSafe in everywhere, including into the XML that makes up your sln file.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The tutorial is aimed at getting you to use the framework and to be up and running with as little configuration as possible. No server to configure, etc. If you are trying to load CSS with the dev server, you will need to pull the CSS from somewhere ""beyond"" the dev server. For example, on my Mac, I launch the dev server, but load the CSS from the built-in apache server.</p></li>
<li><p>There is more info available about using Apache and mod-python here: <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modpython/#howto-deployment-modpython"" rel=""nofollow"">mod_python and apache setup info</a></p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure what you mean by ""creating the directory structure"", but most of the core application files are typically created by running the <code>django-admin.py</code> script, by running <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code>. This is demonstrated in the tutorial.</p></li>

","<p>With interpreted languages you have a lot of freedom.  Freedom isn't free here either.  While the interpreter won't torture you into dotting every i and crossing every T before it deems your code worthy of a run, it also won't try to statically analyze your code for all those problems.  So you have a few choices.</p>

<p>1) {Pyflakes, pychecker, pylint} will do static analysis on your code.  That settles the syntax issue mostly.  </p>

<p>2) Test-driven development with nosetests or the like will help you.  If you make a code change that breaks your existing code, the tests will fail and you will know about it.  This is actually better than static analysis and can be as fast.  If you test-first, then you will have all your code checked at <em>test</em> runtime instead of program runtime.</p>

<p>Note that with 1 &amp; 2 in place you are a bit better off than if you had just a static-typing compiler on your side. Even so, it will not create a proof of correctness.  </p>

<p>It is possible that your tests may miss  some plumbing you need for the app to actually run. If that happens, you fix it by writing more tests usually.  But you still need to fire up the app and bang on it to see what tests you should have written and didn't. </p>

","<p>It seems  you are trying to use the solution marked in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/374572/need-help-variable-creation-in-python"">this</a> question.</p>

<p>If your goal is access values in a loop, you should just use a list.  This weird concept of variable names with numbers in them is not one that should be used in any language.  Try this.</p>

<pre><code>vals = ['foo', 'bar', 'blah', 67, -0.4, 'your mom']
for i in range(len(vals)):
    print(vals[i])
</code></pre>

<p>That is the correct way to have a list of values indexed by an integer, not putting it in the variable name.</p>

","<p>It looks like the code you're generating expands to:</p>

<pre><code>E0=zbc
E1=2.3
</code></pre>

<p>At the next iteration through the loop, you'll get an IndexError exception because <code>a</code> is only two elements long.</p>

<p>So given the above, you are trying to assign the value of <code>zbc</code> to <code>E0</code>. If <code>zbc</code> doesn't exist (which it seems that it doesn't), then you will get the NameError you mention.</p>

<p>It's hard to determine what you're actually trying to do with this code, so I'm not sure what to recommend. You could assign strings instead:</p>

<pre><code>exec('E%d=""%s""' %(i,a[i]))
</code></pre>

<p>This would expand to:</p>

<pre><code>E0=""zbc""
E1=""2.3""
</code></pre>

<p>You would still get the IndexError because your array <code>a</code> is not 5 elements long. That should be an easy fix for you.</p>

","<p>Just keep in mind that 'exec' executes whatever string you pass in to it as if you typed it in your .py file or the interpreter.</p>

<p>When debugging exec() related code, it's helpful to log whatever you're about to 'exec' when you run into trouble, if you did that you'd easily have noticed that E0 wasn't being assigned to the string ""zbc"" but to the non-existent object zbc.</p>

<p>Aside from that, this code sample is really weird. Â There are some legitimate uses for parsing strings into instance variables, or objects in other namespaces, most notably when you're coding a highly dynamic class that needs to do sensible stuff with messy input, or needs to setup a bunch of instance variables from a dict or string. Â But without context, the code in your question looks like you're avoiding, or don't understand how, to use list() and dict() objects..</p>

<p>I'd recommend telling a bit more about what you're trying to achieve next time you ask a question around something as peculiar as this. Â That would give people a good opportunity to suggest a better solution, or âif you're approaching a particular problem in a completely sensible wayâ prevent a bunch of answers telling you that you're doing something completely wrong.</p>
